### 

Our major Color Run fundraiser last spring was canceled due to the global pandemic. We know that times are tough for many, so we are **NOT** planning another major fundraiser until we are safely back at school.

If you are able, please consider donating to the Island View PTA so that we can continue to support the Island View staff and students as much as possible.

The Island View PTA is a 501(c)(3), Section 509(a)(2) Tax-Exempt Public Charity (EIN 91-1325723) and our official name with the IRS is Fidalgo-Island View PTA Skagit County. Your gift is tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact: [President - Meg Mourning](mailto:president@islandviewpta.org) or [Vice President - Eric Mithen](mailto:vicepresident@islandviewpta.org)

### **THANK YOU** for your support of all the students and staff at Island View Elementary!
