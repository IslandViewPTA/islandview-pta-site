This year’s major fundraiser is going to be a BLAST! Our team has put together a Color Run fundraiser to help pay for all of the amazing programs our PTA makes possible at Island View, like ClassACT theater, free RIF books, online learning programs, I Love to Read month, Family Fun Nights, Watch DOGS, Scholastic magazines, Mountain School and more!

### How does it work?

Students will gather donations until the **Friday, May 10, 2019 fundraising deadline**, and then participate in a super fun **color run on Saturday, May 18, 2019**. (More information about prizes will be available soon!)

### Personalized Online Donation Page

Students can gather donations in person and online through our website! Only your student’s first name, last initial, and grade will be displayed. Your custom fundraiser link will be emailed to you. Tip: Email your student’s link and share it on Facebook to reach long distance friends and relatives!
