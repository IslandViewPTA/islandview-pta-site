Welcome to the Island View Digital Read Aloud Library!
We want our Island View Eagles to have another place to listen to some wonderful stories read aloud to them.
You can help add videos to the library too! If you are interested in recording reading a book submit a response to our [2021 ILTR Digital Read Aloud Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KtqZSwrjhxoGeYQ-QJi_pZHMj9eOgA9ETJV4e3UXrWY/edit)
