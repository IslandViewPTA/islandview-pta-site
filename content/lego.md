Below you will find more information about the two options you have for you and your student to participate in [FIRST® LEGO® League Jr](#lego-league-jr-ages-6-10-grades-1-4) and [FIRST® LEGO® League](#lego-league-ages-9-14-grades-4-8).

The biggest difference is that Lego League is competitive and requires a greater time/effort commitment, but would be great for students really interested in this kind of activity. 

There is a big 'JOIN!' button on the pages linked to below for registration.  You can specify your preference of a team in the Fall or Spring. Choose both if you are fine with either session, as your student will only be assigned to a team in the Fall or the Spring.

Teams depend on adult coaches and mentors to volunteer.  I hope for a great turn out of students and adults to support their children this year.

## Lego League Jr. (ages 6-10, grades 1-4)

**[FIRST® LEGO® League Jr - Registration Page](http://anacortesrobotics.org/programs/flljr/)**

FIRST® LEGO® League Jr is more than just Legos. Your team of 4-6 friends will EXPLORE a challenge related to a real-world theme, CREATE a model using LEGO WeDO 2.0 technologies, and SHARE the excitement of discovery at community expos and showcases.

Students who participate will explore STEM concepts and real-world scientific problems such as food safety, recycling, energy, etc. They’ll create a Show Me poster that illustrates their journey of discovery and construct a model of what they learned using Lego elements. In the process, teams learn about teamwork, the wonders of science and technology, and the [FIRST LEGO League Jr. Core Values](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/about-fll) which include respect, sharing, and critical thinking.

## Lego League (ages 9-14, grades 4-8)

**[FIRST® LEGO® League - Registration Page](http://anacortesrobotics.org/programs/fll/)**

FIRST® LEGO® League is the most accessible, guided, global robotics competition, helping students and teachers to build a better future together. The program is built around theme-based Challenges to engage children ages 9 to 16* in research, problem solving, coding, and engineering. The foundation of the program is the FIRST® Core Values, which emphasize teamwork, discovery, and innovation. Students emerge more confident, excited, and equipped with the skills they need in a changing workforce.
