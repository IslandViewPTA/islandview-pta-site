## Welcome to Island View PTA!

While we won't be able to be all together in the school building for a while, we are still the **Proud, Soarin' Island View Eagles**, and our community is stronger than ever as we help each other through these strange days.

Here is a link to the latest news from the [**Anacortes School District**](https://www.asd103.org/ "Anacortes School District").

***

We'd like to **THANK** all of those who supported the Island View PTA last year.  We are deeply committed to the staff and students at Island View Elementary, and we could not provide the MANY opportunities we offer without your support!

Due to the pandemic, our reach this year will be limited and we have gutted the budget, but we are still **determined** to fund the staff needs during online learning, and we can't wait to host in-person fun just as soon as it is safe.

By law we must have at least 25 members to remain an active PTA.  Our meetings will only occur when necessary, and will take place online.  

### Won't you please [**JOIN**](https://www.islandviewpta.org/membership/ "JOIN") our Island View PTA family today?

***

Our major Color Run fundraiser last spring was cancelled due to Covid-19, and we are **NOT** planning another major fundraiser until we are safely back at school.

### If your family is in a position to help, we would be so thankful for your tax-deductible [**DONATION**](https://www.islandviewpta.org/donate/ "JOIN") of any size. 

**THANK YOU** for your membership and support of all Island View staff and students!!
