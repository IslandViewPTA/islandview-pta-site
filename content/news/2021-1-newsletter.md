## Principal's Message

## Hospitality Thank You!

December was a busy month for Hospitality and we are so grateful to all of the help from PTA members and supporters! 

The PTA treated Island View staff to a Thank You Car Parade, provided holiday decorations to decorate the staff lounge, and packaged 45 staff treat bags of donated goodies. Special thanks to the Hospitality Elves that assembled the treats bags! Our school staff have been so caring with our kids, and the PTA happily showered them with thanks and holiday cheer! 

Check out this video of the Island View staff sharing their gratitude for all of your thoughtfulness and uplifting support as we team with them to make the best of this tough situation. 

On the calendar are parent teacher conferences in March. We typically provide a dinner for staff but with COVID and a reduced budget (due to the absence of fundraisers), we will get creative again! More information coming soon! Contact Stacey Mahoney at [hospitality@islandviewpta.org](hospitality@islandviewpta.org) with your hospitality ideas and to volunteer for upcoming events.

## YEARBOOK Photos Needed

**Call for photos of Island View students doing the school thing! Make the 2020-2021 yearbook the best ever by submitting photos of your student(s).**

Please email your photos to [**yearbook@islandviewpta.org**](mailto:yearbook@islandviewpta.org). In the email please include your students’ names, grades, and teachers.

We’ll do our best to make sure everyone is included, so snap away! Thank you!

## Give the Gift of Membership

The new year is an ideal time to give something meaningful to others by gifting a [membership to Island View PTA! ](https://www.islandviewpta.org/membership)

Membership entitles you or someone dear to you to join the ranks of the most caring and dedicated PTA on Fidalgo Island. Don't forget to sponsor a staff membership, as we are currently **only 4 staff members away from 100% staff membership!**

Super easy and it means a world of difference to our staff & students! Thank you for your support!
