## Principal's Message

## Hospitality Thank You!

December was a busy month for Hospitality and we are so grateful to all of the help from PTA members and supporters!

The PTA treated Island View staff to a Thank You Car Parade, provided holiday decorations to decorate the staff lounge, and packaged 45 staff treat bags of donated goodies. Special thanks to the Hospitality Elves that assembled the treats bags! Our school staff have been so caring with our kids, and the PTA happily showered them with thanks and holiday cheer!

Check out this video of the Island View staff sharing their gratitude for all of your thoughtfulness and uplifting support as we team with them to make the best of this tough situation.

On the calendar are parent teacher conferences in March. We typically provide a dinner for staff but with COVID and a reduced budget (due to the absence of fundraisers), we will get creative again! More information coming soon! Contact Stacey Mahoney at [hospitality@islandviewpta.org](mailto:hospitality@islandviewpta.org) with your hospitality ideas and to volunteer for upcoming events.

You all are doing a fabulous job and we LOVE seeing them. :D If you haven't already sent in pictures, but would like to share, feel free to email them to [membership@islandviewpta.org](mailto:membership@islandviewpta.org) or send it to us via Facebook messenger.

## Support ISV with Box Tops!

Box Tops is a super easy way to help earn money for our school! If you have any physical Box Tops, they're still collecting them. If you are willing and able to download the Box Tops app and scan your receipt, any Box Tops eligible items are automatically calculated. Every little bit counts, especially this year, so thank you for your help!

## ASF Says THANK YOU!

Thank you again to everyone that donated to the Island View "Some Like It Hot" Fire Pit for the Anacortes Schools Foundation's annual "Celebrate the Season" fundraiser! Thanks to all the supporters, donors, sponsors and attendees, ASF was able to raise a whopping $185,839 for Anacortes students this year! If you'd be interested in volunteering with ASF any time throughout the year, please email ASF Executive Director, Marta McClintock at [marta@asfkids.org](marta@asfkids.org).

## Volunteer with the best PTA

The Island View PTA always needs more volunteers! If you're interested in helping with or leading any of our committees, please feel free to sign up [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NMMDXuNmEnEvHsQffaEX1p0NksLOK7FnSQnHFbRLLXI/edit?usp=sharing) or send us a message at [membership@islandviewpta.org](mailto:membership@islandviewpta.org). We would also welcome any ideas you have about how we can better support our ISV staff and students this year! THANK YOU!

## YEARBOOK Photos Needed

**Call for photos of Island View students doing the school thing! Make the 2020-2021 yearbook the best ever by submitting photos of your student(s).**

Please email your photos to [yearbook@islandviewpta.org](mailto:yearbook@islandviewpta.org). In the email please include your students’ names, grades, and teachers.

We’ll do our best to make sure everyone is included, so snap away! Thank you!

## Amazon Smile Helps Island View

Thank you to everyone who has Island View PTA selected as their designated non-profit through Amazon Smile! With so many purchases made online this holiday season, the .5% of your purchase price that was automatically donated by Amazon was greatly appreciated!

If you haven't already, it's SUPER EASY! Just designate Island View PTA as the non-profit you'd like the donation made to, shop as usual, and Amazon does the rest!

## Give the Gift of Membership

The new year is an ideal time to give something meaningful to others by gifting a [membership to Island View PTA! ](https://www.islandviewpta.org/membership)

Membership entitles you or someone dear to you to join the ranks of the most caring and dedicated PTA on Fidalgo Island. Don't forget to sponsor a staff membership, as we are currently **only 4 staff members away from 100% staff membership!**

## You're INCREDIBLE!

**THANKS** all those who have supported the Island View PTA already. We are deeply committed to the staff and students at Island View Elementary and we could not provide the MANY opportunities we offer without your support!
