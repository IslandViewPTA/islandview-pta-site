## Principal's Message

Dear Island View Families:

Welcome to 2021! I wish you a year of health and happiness.

I hope you enjoyed a festive holiday season and made magical memories. Still, as wonderful as this time of year can be for families, it also can be a time of pressure-filled obligations and sorrowful memories, especially during our present health crisis. Despite the hectic nature of the season, I hope you found at least brief moments of joy and peace.

As you know, the district plans to reopen schools for K-5 students on January 11. I understand this is good news for many families and concerning news for others. While I share these mixed feelings, I am reminded of what your children taught me in November. They were truly remarkable. At all times, all students wore masks. All students remained in their seats and respected the social distance of their peers. All students remained intently focused on learning. In fact, I can honestly say I have never seen more engaged or well-behaved students in my 30 years in education. Andâ€”a lot can be learned in two-plus hours when there are no distractions or transitions during the day. ðŸ˜Š

However you feel about in-person learning, please know your Island View staff remains committed to ensuring a safe and meaningful school experience for our students. I will email detailed information regarding our reopening plans, including important arrival and departure information, no later than Thursday, January 7th. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) or at 360-503-1490 with any of your questions, suggestions, or concerns.

Again, hereâ€™s to a healthy and happy New Year. See you soon-

Brian

## Hospitality Thank You!

December was a busy month for Hospitality and we are so grateful to PTA members and supporters for all of their help!

The PTA treated Island View staff to a Thank You Car Parade, provided holiday decorations to decorate the staff lounge, and packaged 45 staff treat bags of donated goodies. Special thanks to the Hospitality Elves that assembled the treats bags! Our school staff have been so caring with our kids, and the PTA happily showered them with thanks and holiday cheer!

Check out the YouTube video below of the Island View staff sharing their gratitude for all of your thoughtfulness and uplifting support as we team with them to make the best of this tough situation.

On the calendar are parent teacher conferences in March. We typically provide a dinner for staff but with COVID and a reduced budget (due to the absence of fundraisers), we will get creative again! More information coming soon! Contact Stacey Mahoney at [hospitality@islandviewpta.org](mailto:hospitality@islandviewpta.org) with your hospitality ideas and to volunteer for upcoming events.

## Support ISV with Box Tops!

Box Tops is a super easy way to help earn money for our school! If you have any physical Box Tops, they're still collecting them. If you are willing and able to download the Box Tops app and scan your receipts, any Box Tops eligible items are automatically calculated. Every little bit counts, especially this year, so thank you for your help!

## ASF Says THANK YOU!

Thank you again to everyone that donated to the Island View "Some Like It Hot" Fire Pit for the Anacortes Schools Foundation's annual "Celebrate the Season" fundraiser!

If you'd be interested in volunteering with ASF any time throughout the year, please email ASF Executive Director Marta McClintock at [marta@asfkids.org](mailto:marta@asfkids.org)**.**

## Amazon Smile Helps Island View

Thank you to everyone who has Island View PTA selected as their designated non-profit through Amazon Smile! With so many purchases made online this holiday season, the .5% of your purchase price that was automatically donated by Amazon was greatly appreciated!

If you haven't already, it's SUPER EASY! Just designate Island View PTA as the non-profit you'd like the donation made to, shop as usual, and Amazon does the rest!

## Give the Gift of Membership

The new year is an ideal time to give something meaningful to others by gifting a [membership to Island View PTA! ](https://www.islandviewpta.org/membership)

Membership entitles you or someone dear to you to join the ranks of the most caring and dedicated PTA on Fidalgo Island. Don't forget to sponsor a staff membership, as we are currently **only 4 staff members away from 100% staff membership!**

## You're INCREDIBLE!

**THANKS** all those who have supported the Island View PTA already. We are deeply committed to the staff and students at Island View Elementary and we could not provide the MANY opportunities we offer without your support!
