On behalf of the entire school community, the Island View PTA would like to say a huge **THANK YOU** to the ASD administration, staff, and our beloved teachers! During a global pandemic, you are working so hard to make this year as “normal” and wonderful for your students as you possibly can. You are adapting new curriculum, learning multiple platforms, and revising instruction to work in a virtual world. You are leaning into equity work with open hearts and minds ready to dive deep into long overdue conversations. You are prioritizing social and emotional learning which will help your students, and indeed the world, heal from this global trauma. You are doing everything you can to figure out how to build relationships and love your students the moment they “walk into your room.” Educators are truly Essential Workers and are the key to the entire economy. You are showing the world and your students what **resilience** really is. You are so very very appreciated and we are deeply honored that you do all you do for our children! THANK YOU!
