**Island View families are the BEST!!** I am so amazed by the overwhelming support from the families and staff at our school. 

Our ambitious goal for this fundraiser was $8,000. After tallying everything on Friday, the total raised was **$12,421**! 

That's incredible! 

That's amazing! 

That's just how Island View soars! 

**Classroom Competitions**

* **Highest Participation: Mr. Lincoln's Class**

Mr. Lincoln's class won the Participation competition with 57% of his students raising money for the PTA. They win a game of kickball with Mr. Hanrahan! Congratulations!

We also have awards for the top fundraising students. The top 5 students will get to be Assistant Principal, and the top 20 will get to attend a Soo Bahk Do karate board breaking party, donated by Anacortes Soo Bahk Do! A list of students who won will be posted at school on Monday. 

  
**Did you miss the deadline?** 

**If you still want to participate and get the prizes but missed the deadline, bring in your donations this week.** We would love to have you join us at the Color Run on Saturday! We'll start prepping prize bags this week and distribute them on Friday afternoon. Shirts can be picked up at the Color Run on Saturday or in the PTA office the following week. 

Thank you so much for supporting Island View PTA at our messiest FUNdraiser of the year!
