## Principal's Message

Island View Families:

I love how the school year follows the seasons. As October comes to an end, the tree outside my office window is on fire with red-orange leaves. Our hallways are adorned with artwork that celebrates the time of yearâ€”beautiful birch trees, friendly Frankensteins, and red farm trucks ladened with pumpkins.

True to the bountiful season, October is a full and busy month: fall testing is complete, conferences are over, and students have settled into productive routines. As I spend time in classrooms, I see your children actively engaged in collaborative learning. For example, I recently watched two students discuss (in a productively argumentative wayðŸ˜Š) the best way to draw a leaf in their science journals. I am very proud of the learning opportunities your teachers create for your students.

It is hard to believe we are moving into the Thanksgiving season. At Island View, we try to nurture a culture that celebrates gratitude and thankfulness daily. That said, November is a good month to really take stock of the many gifts we have as a community. My life is filled with much gratitudeâ€”I am grateful to be part of a caring and hard-working staff; I am grateful for an **INCREDIBLE** school community and PTA; and finally, I am grateful for 417 students who make me smile and laugh and feel joy every day.

I wish you a November filled with warm family experiences and a time of thanksgiving.

Brian

## Gratitude Group

This year for the Gratitude Wall we will take our gratitude off the wall and out into the community. 

Very soon we will send your child home with a post card...this is to give to a community member special to them. Maybe they have a favorite waitress or a bookstore worker that is always kind. A friendly face at a gas station, a pastor at church, a grandmother, the business owner of their favorite place, a stranger that is kind, the mail delivery person---anyone they see doing something nice. If possible, take time searching for someone that they can give it to!

(There is also space on back for students to write a personal note and sign their name---win-win, another chance to practice writing!)

Now here is the fun part! Take a picture with whomever they give the card to and the PTA will print those to put on the gratitude wall!

Email pictures to [yestokindness@gmail.com](mailto:yestokindness@gmail.com) or text (518)593-4741.

This is a super easy, fun way to teach our kids to look for the good in the world and share gratitude! Watch for this postcard coming home soon! Any questions please contact Tammy Guffey, [yestokindness@gmail.com](mailto:yestokindness@gmail.com)
