## Gratitude Group

This year for the Gratitude Wall we will take our gratitude off the wall and out into the community. 

Very soon we will send your child home with a post card...this is to give to a community member special to them. Maybe they have a favorite waitress or a bookstore worker that is always kind. A friendly face at a gas station, a pastor at church, a grandmother, the business owner of their favorite place, a stranger that is kind, the mail delivery person---anyone they see doing something nice. If possible, take time searching for someone that they can give it to!

(There is also space on back for students to write a personal note and sign their name---win-win, another chance to practice writing!)

Now here is the fun part! Take a picture with whomever they give the card to and the PTA will print those to put on the gratitude wall!

Email pictures to [yestokindness@gmail.com](mailto:yestokindness@gmail.com) or text (518)593-4741.

This is a super easy, fun way to teach our kids to look for the good in the world and share gratitude! Watch for this postcard coming home soon! Any questions please contact Tammy Guffey, [yestokindness@gmail.com](mailto:yestokindness@gmail.com)
