## Principal's Message

***

Island View Families:

First, I want to thank you for the many words of gratitude you have shared with me about the Island View staff. I have been inspired by the effort, openness, and creativity of your teachers and support staff. They have worked very hard to make the fall reopening engaging and meaningful for students. Thank you for noticing.

As we now prepare for in-person learning to begin in November, I would like to acknowledge the different sentiments I have heard from families. Some of you eagerly anticipate our return to the building; some of you have deep concerns about students being together in person; and some of you feel a combination of happiness, fear, and uncertainty. I understand and value these mixed feelings. In the end, I trust you will make the right decision for your family.

During October, I will work closely with district and school staff to provide a safe environment for students. Specifically, we are currently developing plans to ensure:

* Staff and families follow all safety protocols.
* Staff and students wear masks or face coverings.
* Students arrive and depart school in an orderly and safe manner.
* Hand sanitizer units are available throughout the building.
* School custodians implement strict disinfection protocols, ensuring all classrooms are cleaned before students enter the spaces.
* Student movement in the building is limited.
* Classrooms have a reduced number of students.
* Desks are spaced 6 feet apart.
* Student groups are kept from mixing in shared spaces.
* A supervised holding room is available for students who are not feeling well.
* Communication is open and consistent between school and families.

If you have questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding our reopening plans, please do not hesitate to contact me at 360-503-1490 or at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org).

Obviously, this is not my typical October message. I would much rather write about the festive and fun artwork that adorns our hallways—the pumpkins, bats, ghosts, and ghouls. But that is not our reality this fall. Whatever your family decides to do as Island View reopens to in-person learning, I am confident the spirit and love that binds our school community will continue to hold us all together. Perhaps even a bit more strongly than ever before.

I continue to be grateful for and inspired by the proud, soarin’ Island View eagles—students and adults alike.

Stay well-

Brian Hanrahan

It's never too early to start working on the yearbook!

Please send us photos of your Island View students hard at work or play. First day of school, singing along with music class, jumping for gym, or just playing at the closest playground - anything is great.

With the upcoming return to school any bus stop photos are also a plus.

Please email your photos to [yearbook@islandviewpta.org](mailto:yearbook@islandviewpta.org). In the email please include your students' names, grades, and teachers.

We'll do our best to make sure everyone is included. Thank you!
