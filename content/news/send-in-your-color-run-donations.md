Have you noticed that your online donation page doesn't list the money you collected in person? Send in your Color Run donations as you collect them and we'll update the page for you! 

Put your donations in an envelope with your name and teacher clearly marked on the front, and drop it in the PTA drop box in the office. Keep your big envelope so you can keep fundraising! We'll start posting classroom totals soon so you'll know which class is in the lead for that ice cream party and kickball game!
