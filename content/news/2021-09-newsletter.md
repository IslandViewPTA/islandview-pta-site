## Principal's Message

**Welcome to the 2021-22 school year!** I know we are all hoping to return to a more “normal” year after the last 18 months. I got a small taste of our students’ excitement at the district’s recent Ready to Learn Fair, where I saw several Island View families. As one dad told me, “My students can’t wait for school to start. They are so excited!” The whole staff feels the same strong enthusiasm.

As we prepare for the start of school, I know parents have many questions. I hope you find the following information helpful.

* If your child will be riding the bus, please fill out the online bus request form **by September 1st**: [https://sites.google.com/asd103.org/transportation/bus-requests](https://sites.google.com/asd103.org/transportation/bus-requests "https://sites.google.com/asd103.org/transportation/bus-requests"). This form needs to be completed each year.
* By September 3rd, I will send families a detailed power point presentation that explains our plans for student arrival, dismissal, lunch, recess, and other important protocols.
* We will have an in-person **“Meet and Greet” on September 7th from 3:30-5:30**. Students and parents will have an opportunity to meet teachers and visit classrooms. To limit the number of families in the building at any time, I will send a Sign-Up Genius link so families can select a 15-minute slot to visit the school. Office staff will be at tables outside to help families with meal accounts, transportation questions, and other support needs. Please look for the emailed link by September 3rd. Masks are required.
* Volunteers in schools: The district is currently working on a possible plan/timeline for allowing volunteers in schools. But no volunteers will be permitted in buildings during the first month of school.
* If you have other questions, please contact me at bhanrahan@asd103.org or at 360-503-1490.

One thing I have always appreciated about our school community is the way students, staff, and family members value and respect one another. We work together to build an inspiring school for our students. Last year solidified my deep respect for and belief in the Island View community. Whatever this year brings, I am certain of one thing—your students will continue to grow, learn, and thrive. It’s what I fondly call our proud, soarin’ flight.

I cannot wait to see you all very soon.

Brian Hanrahan

## The SHELL Fun Run is back...in person!

**Register for the Fueling Education Fun Run and help Island View win $5,000!!**

Every September Puget Sound Refinery puts on this amazing event which brings our community together and helps raise close to $50,000 a year to support Anacortes students. Funds raised during last year’s 6th Annual (but first ever virtual) event supported COVID Relief Grants in all ASD schools and STEM College Scholarships. This year, the focus will be on Mental Health support for our students. In addition, Puget Sound Refinery provides a $5,000 grant to the ASD school with the highest percentage of their student body that participates in this race. All ASD staff and students are eligible to participate in this competition to help their school win $5,000! Last year it was a close race and we'd love for Island View to be the winner this year!

This year's 5K and Kids Race will be held on Sunday, September 19th at Washington Park. There is also a virtual option for anyone who is interested. For more information about the race and to register, visit [asfkids.org/funrun](http://www.asfkids.org/funrun).

## Are you passionate about Arts for our children?

From the WSPTA Website: "Reflections is a National PTA arts recognition program that helps students explore their own thoughts, feelings and ideas, develop artistic literacy, increase confidence, and find a love for learning that will help them become more successful not only in school, but in life. Students in pre-K through grade 12 create original works of art in response to a theme. The theme for the 2021-2022 program year is I Will Change The World By… Students submit their completed works of art in one, or all, of the available arts categories: Dance Choreography, Film Production, Literature, Music Composition, Photography, Visual Arts. While the primary focus of Reflections is a celebration of creativity through positive recognition, finalists from local PTAs will move on to their council PTA (if applicable), then finalists from councils will move on to the state round. Washington State PTA finalists who receive an “Outstanding Interpretation” award will advance to the National PTA round."

Students can only submit entries for the Reflections program through their school's PTA. We would love for our Island View Eagles to have the opportunity to participate in this wonderful program, but we need volunteers to make it work. WSPTA provides the full outline for a successful program and a team of 4-6 volunteers (plus judges) will be needed. If available, the program would need to be announced to the students in September since entries are due in January. If you are interested in leading or volunteering for this program, please reach out to Membership Coordinator, Rachel Esposito, at [membership@islandviewpta.org](mailto:membership@islandviewpta.org).
