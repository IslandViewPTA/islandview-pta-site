## Principal's Message

**Welcome to the 2021-22 school year!** I know we are all hoping to return to a more “normal” year after the last 18 months. I got a small taste of our students’ excitement at the district’s recent Ready to Learn Fair, where I saw several Island View families. As one dad told me, “My students can’t wait for school to start. They are so excited!” The whole staff feels the same strong enthusiasm.

As we prepare for the start of school, I know parents have many questions. I hope you find the following information helpful.

* By September 3rd, I will send families a detailed power point presentation that explains our plans for student arrival, dismissal, lunch, recess, and other important protocols.
* We will have an in-person **“Meet and Greet” on September 7th from 3:30-5:30**. Students and parents will have an opportunity to meet teachers and visit classrooms. To limit the number of families in the building at any time, I will send a Sign-Up Genius link so families can select a 15-minute slot to visit the school. Office staff will be at tables outside to help families with meal accounts, transportation questions, and other support needs. Please look for the emailed link by September 3rd. Masks are required.
* If your child will be riding the bus, please fill out the online bus request form **by September 1st**: [https://sites.google.com/asd103.org/transportation/bus-requests](https://sites.google.com/asd103.org/transportation/bus-requests "https://sites.google.com/asd103.org/transportation/bus-requests"). This form needs to be completed each year.
* Volunteers in schools: The district is currently working on a possible plan/timeline for allowing volunteers in schools. But no volunteers will be permitted in buildings during the first month of school.
* If you have other questions, please contact me at bhanrahan@asd103.org or at 360-503-1490.

One thing I have always appreciated about our school community is the way students, staff, and family members value and respect one another. We work together to build an inspiring school for our students. Last year solidified my deep respect for and belief in the Island View community. Whatever this year brings, I am certain of one thing—your students will continue to grow, learn, and thrive. It’s what I fondly call our proud, soarin’ flight.

I cannot wait to see you all very soon.

Brian Hanrahan

## Welcome Back to School!

While we may not be able to be together in person, we are still Proud, Soarin' Island View Eagles, and we can't wait to see your beautiful faces again, even if only through a screen.

**Show your school spirit from home!** Each student will receive a page to color and put up in their window for all to see! Then you can send a picture of your Eagle with their sign, or any signs you spot in town, to [membership@islandviewpta.org](mailto:membership@islandviewpta.org) and we will share them on Facebook.

We miss you and can't wait to "see" you soon!

## N-O-W is the time to JOIN PTA!

**Join the Island View PTA today!**

We're back and ready to have a fabulous year, but we need YOU!

Join the Island View PTA **by October 30, 2021** and you will be entered into a raffle to win a gift certificate for a 1.5 hour kayak trip at Deception Pass with [Anacortes Kayak Tours](https://www.anacorteskayaktours.com/), an AKT T-shirt and an AKT pint glass!

Joining the PTA doesn't mean you need to volunteer; we understand you're busy and we would never ask you to take on more than you have time for. Joining the PTA DOES mean you'll be well-informed, engaged and an advocate for your student and studies have shown that these things make a difference for student success in school and beyond. Anyone can join the PTA! Parents, grandparents, friends, neighbors, community members - we would love to have them all supporting our students! We want our Island View Eagles to soar and you can help! Visit [islandviewpta.org/membership](http://www.islandviewpta.org/membership) to join today.
