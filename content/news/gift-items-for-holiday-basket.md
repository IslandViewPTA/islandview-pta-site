Anacortes Schools Foundation (ASF) raises and directs money for scholarships, programs, learning experiences, and materials benefitting our students from preschool through college entrance. One of their major fundraising events, Celebrate the Season, is coming up and they've asked for our help!  

[Sign up](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0d44aead2da3f58-items) to purchase an item and bring it to the PTA office by Nov 25th with a note "For Nicole" on it. The items will be compiled in a phenomenal, jaw-dropping basket for the event on Dec 7.

When shopping, kindly select items that are seasonal in theme--think "festive winter"--so as to appeal to the widest range of bidders!

(Note: ASF and the Celebrate the Season event are not district sponsored or endorsed.)
