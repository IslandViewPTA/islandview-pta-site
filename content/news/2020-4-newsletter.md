## Principal's Message

Island View Families:

Let me begin with the obviousüòä: much has occurred in recent weeks. I hope you are navigating this health situation in a way that keeps your family balanced and healthy. As I communicated in my recent letter to families, please do not hesitate to contact your student‚Äôs teacher or me if you have any questions, concerns, or needs. I can be reached anytime at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) or at 360-503-1490. We are here to help and support you and your students.

Before the COVID situation took hold of our community, we had some very cool experiences in March. Thanks to the efforts of PTA member Christina Hansen, our ‚ÄúI Love to Read‚Äù festivities were well under way with mystery book clues, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been caught reading‚Äù drawings, student book announcers, and a student-created ‚Äúbook worm‚Äù that is already hundreds of feet long in our north hallway. We also welcomed the new ASD superintendent at the Island View PTA meeting in March. I was not surprised that Dr. Justin Irish was particularly impressed by our school community‚Äôs efforts and genuine care for our students. Then, later in the month, we hosted a well-attended garden gathering. As a brisk wind cut through the sun-splashed morning, 40+ parents and students enjoyed hot cider and prepared our garden by pulling weeds, spreading mulch, and planting seeds. It was a positive and future-oriented event: undoubtedly the seeds planted will grow tall and strong. Just like our students.

Currently, we are in a position that requires patience and hopeful thinking. We have many opportunities and events planned for our students and community‚Äîa spring concert, a book fair, a color run, and many end-of-year events and field trips. As the situation unfolds, I will update families on our plans.

I have to say the last week as your principal has been deeply inspiring to me. I have read staff communications and posts to families, I‚Äôve watched staff videos to students, and I have seen many student responses. All of these ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù interactions demonstrate the depth of our school community. We will continue to thrive during this challenging time because we are working together. That is what community is all about‚Äîa work in progress. Together.

To close, I must simply admit that I miss your kids. I miss their high-fives and fist-bumps. Their smiles and laughter and hugs. Their intense curiosity and incessant questioning. Their unabashed love of learning. Their pride in doing a task well. Their kind gestures. Even their tears and unfortunate choices. üòâ As you share moments of love and support with your students, please let them know the whole Island View staff feels the same way about them.

I hope to see you soon. Take care and stay healthy.

Brian

## Thank You, Dr. Irish...

**Our warmest thanks to Incoming Superintendent of Anacortes Public Schools, Dr. Justin Irish, for joining us at our March 4th PTA meeting!** We are grateful for the gift of his time and look forward to hearing more in the coming months about his transition into the Superintendent role.

## Yearbook

We still plan to publish an Island View YEARBOOK this year - because let's face it, this is likely the year our kids will remember longer/stronger than any other in their childhoods.

Please send photos of what you are doing during these weeks away from school: homeschooling, going on walks, reading, playing, etc. We'd love pictures from the teachers and staff, too: What are you up to? Show us how life is different now, or how it is the same.

Please send pictures to [yearbook@islandviewpta.org](mailto:yearbook@islandviewpta.org)

Thank you!  

## Bravo!

Our sincere appreciation for the efforts of many PTA volunteers in March for putting together some incredible events.

### I Love to Read Month

Thank you to all of the students and staff that embraced the many ways to celebrate reading in March! The PTA is grateful for so much support, including two Guest Readers from our community and at least two Book Fairy sightings that had striking similarities to Mrs. Shainin and Mr. Fountain.  Thanks to all those that made the celebrations possible and memorable!

### Spring Garden Party

Our most sincere gratitude to all of the Island View students, families, and staff for taking time on March 14th to get the school garden ready for this year's growing season. It was a huge success and we look forward to seeing the garden grow and thrive again this year!
