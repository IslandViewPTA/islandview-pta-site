## It's time to think...YEARBOOK

Our yearbook is in production, and we need your school event photos! Do you have treasured images from field trips, classrooms, lunches, recess, or pre/after school events? We'd love to publish them.

Just email your images to [yearbook@islandviewpta.org](mailto:yearbook@islandviewpta.org) or drop off a disk or flash drive at the office. Please be sure to include your name and contact information with all submissions. Photos should be hi resolution color JPGs. Please include the teacher and/or classroom for the students in your photos.

We can't wait to see what you've got. Thank you!
