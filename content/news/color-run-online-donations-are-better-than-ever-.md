This year's Color Run is going to be a BLAST, and gathering online donations has never been easier! Our Expert in All Things Internet made some updates to the student donation pages to show how much they've raised. Now you'll know just how close you are to reaching your goal!

**How can I get a donation page for my Island View Eagle?**

Parents and guardians can visit [Island View PTA Color Run](/colorrun) to complete the authorization form. After we get that notification, you'll get an email from the PTA with your personalized URL. Only your student's first name, last initial and grade will be listed.

After you get your personalized URL, email it to long distance friends and family. Don't forget to post it on Facebook, too! 

Thank you for being part of this incredible fundraiser!
