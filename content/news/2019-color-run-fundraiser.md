### Join us for a fun, MESSY fundraiser!

It's time for the Island View Color Run Fundraiser!

**Step 1: GATHER DONATIONS**

Ask everyone you know: parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins – your whole family! Also, ask family friends and neighbors. Bring your fundraising envelope to sports practice, community events, dance classes, everywhere!

**You can even gather donations ONLINE!**  
Ask an adult to share your personal fundraising page on Facebook and in emails using your link. If you haven’t signed up for an online donation page yet, ask a parent or guardian to visit [**www.islandviewpta.org/colorrun**](http://www.islandviewpta.org/colorrun).

**Step 2: RETURN DONATIONS TO PTA BY: MAY 13, 2019 at 9:00 am**

**Friends and family can join in the fun for just $25 each!** Their admission counts towards your fundraising goal! This is not a pledge event. All donations will be collected in advance. Scholarships available - email [president@islandviewpta.org](mailto:president@islandviewpta.org).

Please make checks payable to Island View PTA.

**Step 3: GET MESSY!**

Join us on May 18, 2019 at 9:30 am at Island View for a very fun, very messy COLOR RUN! Run to stations around the school to get splattered with color!
