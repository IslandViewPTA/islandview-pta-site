## Principal's Message

Island View Families:

As we welcomed students back into the building this month, I stand in awe of our school community. Staff are working together to ensure students are safe and nurtured, and families are showing patience and grace by following our guidelines and protocols. Thank you for your positive partnership.

Yet, I must admit I am not surprised. Afterall, we are the proud, soarinâ€™ Island View eagles ðŸ˜Š .

I have spent every free moment I can muster in classrooms, and **your children are inspiring**. They wear masks when they would rather not wear them. They keep calm bodies and socially distance from their peers. They joyfully engage in learning. Every time I walk into a classroom and watch our talented staff work with your gifted students, I am reminded that loving relationships form the heart of education. We understand that heart at Island View.

Because we realize the importance of relationships, the Island View staff has created a staff Charter, which codifies how we want to feel at school and how we want to make others feel. Below is a draft of our charter:

**As staff at Island View Elementary School, we want to create a work environment that helps us feel:**

Â· **VALUED**

Â· **SAFE**

Â· **SUPPORTED**

Â· **INSPIRED**

Â· **CONTENT**

Â· **COLLABORATIVE**

We believe if adults in the building nurture these feelings, our students will thrive. Ultimately, that is our primary hope. If there is anything we can do to help your student thrive at this time, please reach out to me at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) or at 360-503-1490.

I wish you a Happy Thanksgiving. Enjoy your family. Make memories. And stay well-

Brian Hanrahan
