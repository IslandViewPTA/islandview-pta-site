## Last PTA Meeting and Elections!

![](/uploads/zoom-logo.png)

**Live via ZOOM on Wednesday, May 6 at 6 pm, there will be one final PTA meeting** for the 2019-2020 school year. We will elect new board officers and vote on the proposed budget for next school year.

We must have quorum for these important votes, so please plan to Zoom with us.  The Meeting ID is **308 670 879** and we will send out the password just prior to the meeting (to protect against Zoom-Bombers).

Thanks in advance for joining us - it will be so good to see familiar faces again!

## Staff Appreciation!

Staff Appreciation Week is **May 4 - 8, 2020**.  Our wonderful staff need to feel the love even more this year, while we are far apart.  Please take a moment to send a note to some of our beloved Island View teachers and staff to show them your gratitude for all they do for us throughout the year.
