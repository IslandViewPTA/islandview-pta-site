## Principal's Message

Dear Island View Families:

I hope you are staying healthy and hopeful during these challenging times. As cliché as it sounds, we are experiencing something new and unprecedented in education, in our community, and in our world.

As surprised as I have been by our recent health crisis, I have to say I’m not at all surprised by our school community. The Island View staff has worked very hard to develop engaging experiences and lessons for students in our “virtual” online setting. I have also received many emails and communications from parents and students, asking questions, sharing ideas, and voicing constructive concerns. In all respects, I have been impressed with the patience and understanding all have displayed. I cannot thank you enough for your productive partnerships.

I know many questions remain, big and small. What will “moving-up” look like for our 5th graders? What will report cards look like at the end of the school year? How will class pictures be distributed? How can students get materials they left at school? And many more. I will continue to process these questions and communicate regularly with families.

I miss your students greatly and relish any opportunity I get to engage with them. Daily birthday calls have become my favorite part of the day. I visit classroom Seesaw pages just to see your students record their reading and writing. Recently, I was walking in town and a student yelled out of a car window, “Hi Mr. Hanrahan!” While I couldn’t identify the student, it didn’t matter at all. I immediately responded, “I miss you!” And that is the truth.

As this school closure continues to the end of the year, please know I am here to help and support you and your students. If you have any questions, concerns, or school needs, please don’t hesitate to contact me at 360-503-1490 or at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org). I believe strongly in our Island View eagles, students and adults alike. Our current health crisis is certainly challenging, but it cannot keep us shackled to the ground.

Not for a second. We are proud, soarin’ eagles—always.

Brian Hanrahan, Principal

## Last PTA Meeting and Elections!

{{< fig src="zoom.png" class="max-w-xs" align="center" >}}

**Live via ZOOM on Wednesday, May 6 at 6 pm, there will be one final PTA meeting** for the 2019-2020 school year. We will elect new board officers and vote on the proposed budget for next school year.

We must have quorum for these important votes, so please plan to Zoom with us.  The Meeting ID is **308 670 879** and we will send out the password just prior to the meeting (to protect against Zoom-Bombers).

Thanks in advance for joining us - it will be so good to see familiar faces again!
