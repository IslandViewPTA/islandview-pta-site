## Principal's Message

Dear Island View Families:

As I considered this final newsletter message of 2020, I thought sadly, ‚Äúit will be as unusual as the year itself.‚Äù There will be no reminders of holiday concerts or tree-lighting ceremonies, no mention of our sing-along or plump Santas adorning our hallways. Moreover, the recent need to suspend in-person learning felt like one final trick of the year. Students and teachers were thriving in classrooms, and our arrival/dismissal processes and safety measures were running smoothly. The closure felt like unfair punishment.

But then I remembered something important‚Äî**my focus creates my feelings**. In other words, when I focus on what I am missing, I feel downright despondent; conversely, when I focus on what I am lucky to have, I feel hopeful and inspired.

As a school community we should feel and share much hope. Our students and staff are healthy and resilient. They successfully navigated remote learning for the first two months of the school year and are fully prepared to pivot back to that model. Before we began in-person learning on November 2nd, many parents told me the remote model was working so well they questioned the move back to in-person learning. Then after November 2nd, parents told me their students were happy and engaged‚Äîeven being at school for half days.

These successes clearly show the strength of our school community. They show that whatever situation arises, we tenaciously find a way to continue our proud, soarin‚Äô Island View eagle flight.

That said, I realize there is much more to the story. Families have been forced to modify schedules, develop support networks, and endure other sacrifices. Some students have struggled with social-emotional and academic challenges. Still, my hope lies in the strength of our school community. I know all will be well. We will emerge strong and united. That is how we fly.

Do not hesitate to reach out to me at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) or at 360-503-1490 if you have questions, concerns, or needs.

Please try hard to stay focused on the positives this holiday season. Smile and laugh a lot. Hug your students. And stay well.

See you in a healthful and prosperous 2021üòä.

Brian Hanrahan
