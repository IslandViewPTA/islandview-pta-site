## Principal's Message

Dear Island View Families:

In honor of the season, your Island View PTA created a gratitude wall for staff and students. Not surprisingly, students are reaching out to staff with messages of thanksgiving. Here is a small sampling:

· “Thank you for being my teacher. You help me so much.”

· “Thank you…now I know what to do this year in 3rd grade.”

· “Thank you for teaching me division.”

· “Thank you for helping me get started in math and reading.”

· “Thank you for teaching us.”

I am always inspired by the simplicity and honesty of student feedback. I have a sticker in my office that reads “Listen to Children,” which is something I strive to do every day. With that goal in mind, students in grades 3-5 recently took an anonymous survey that is designed to measure their sense of belonging and empowerment at school. Sample questions included the following:

· Students help each other at school.

· I feel important in my classroom.

· The principal knows my name.

· Teachers care if I am absent from school.

· I like going to school.

· My teacher helps me reach my goals.

The data we receive from the survey helps us improve our school community. Last year, for instance, the Island View student leadership team used the data to develop a kindness campaign at school. All told, listening to children is an important part of the Island View mission. If you would like more information on the survey, please [visit this link.](https://surveys.quagliainstitute.org/?loc=US)

As we move into the exciting but stressful holiday season, I offer several reminders. Children follow emotional cues from parents, so…

Relax. Rest when you need to. Savor simple moments of pleasure like reading a book or watching a movie or going for a hike with your child. Breathe. Be grateful for this special time in your child’s life. That time is the most precious gift of the season. Truly.

Enjoy a December of warm memories with family and friends.

Brian Hanrahan, Principal
