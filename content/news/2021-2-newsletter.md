## Principal's Message

Dear Island View Families:

I cannot express the joy I feel having your students back in the building. As I walk the halls and see their artistic wonders‚Äîsnow people and snow globes, student images and MLK portraits‚Äîmy spirit is buoyed by the creative genius of your kids. Their artwork also reminds me that while students are in the building for a short time each day, there is still time for artistic exploration. Life at Island View is goodüòä.

I would like to thank all our families for the smooth return to in-person learning. Your patience, cooperation, and understanding have been inspiring. From arrival and dismissal protocols to attestation processes and communication with staff, everything has run smoothly with your help. Thank you.

Students have also been remarkable. I must confess, one thing I love about our current situation is the amount of time I get with your children. I am blessed to greet them when they arrive, say goodbye to them when they leave, and see them in classrooms regularly. Recently I had a beautiful hallway interaction with a 1st grade student. After I called out the student‚Äôs name, our exchange went something like this‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat made it great?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, but can you pick just one thing that made your day great?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeing back at school, Mr. Hanrahan!‚Äù

Her twinkling eyes betrayed a broad smile under her mask.

This interaction embodies our collective community work. Through a strong partnership with you, the Island View staff has created a school environment where kids feel they belong. They know they are seen and appreciated. And loved.

That is what I call proud, soarin‚Äô Island View eagle flight.

As always, please reach out to me at 360-503-1490 or at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions.

Stay well-

Brian Hanrahan

## Hospitality News & Events

**The Hospitality Committee is excitedly looking forward to Valentine's Day!** We will be spreading the love by decorating the school's exterior doors on Friday, Feb. 12. Students will be bringing home a red or pink piece of construction paper if they would like to contribute to the school decorations. Bins will be placed outside the student/bus drop off areas for students to bring their decorations on Feb. 4 and 5.

**Donut Delivery!** The Island View PTA sweetened the first day back for bus drivers with the delivery of two dozen Donut House donuts. Hospitality volunteer Jenessa Eelkema dropped off the donuts in the predawn hours of Jan 11 and we received this sweet note in return, "With much gratitude...Thank you for the donuts on Monday at the bus garage, we did not leave any crumbs!"

**Let us know if you would like to be part of the magic of the Hospitality Committee, showing our love by sharing edible joy!** [hospitality@islandviewpta.org](mailto:hospitality@islandviewpta.org)

## Box Tops Benefit Island View

**Box Tops is an EASY way to earn money for our school!**

If you have any physical Box Tops, they're still collecting them. If you are willing and able to download the Box Tops app and scan your receipts, any Box Tops eligible items are automatically calculated. Every little bit counts, especially this year!

## Amazon Smile Helps Island View

**Thank you to everyone who has Island View PTA selected as their designated non-profit through Amazon Smile!**

If you haven't already, it's SUPER EASY! Just designate Island View PTA as the non-profit you'd like the donation made to, shop as usual, and Amazon does the rest!

## Give the Gift of Membership

The new year is an ideal time to give something meaningful to others by gifting a [membership to Island View PTA! ](https://www.islandviewpta.org/membership)

Membership entitles you or someone dear to you to join the ranks of the most caring and dedicated PTA on Fidalgo Island. Don't forget to sponsor a staff membership, as we are currently **only 4 staff members away from 100% staff membership!**
