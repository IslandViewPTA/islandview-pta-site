## Principal's Message

Dear Island View Families:

I cannot express the joy I feel having your students back in the building. As I walk the halls and see their artistic wonders‚Äîsnow people and snow globes, student images and MLK portraits‚Äîmy spirit is buoyed by the creative genius of your kids. Their artwork also reminds me that while students are in the building for a short time each day, there is still time for artistic exploration. Life at Island View is goodüòä.

I would like to thank all our families for the smooth return to in-person learning. Your patience, cooperation, and understanding have been inspiring. From arrival and dismissal protocols to attestation processes and communication with staff, everything has run smoothly with your help. Thank you.

Students have also been remarkable. I must confess, one thing I love about our current situation is the amount of time I get with your children. I am blessed to greet them when they arrive, say goodbye to them when they leave, and see them in classrooms regularly. Recently I had a beautiful hallway interaction with a 1st grade student. After I called out the student‚Äôs name, our exchange went something like this‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat made it great?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, but can you pick just one thing that made your day great?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeing back at school, Mr. Hanrahan!‚Äù

Her twinkling eyes betrayed a broad smile under her mask.

This interaction embodies our collective community work. Through a strong partnership with you, the Island View staff has created a school environment where kids feel they belong. They know they are seen and appreciated. And loved.

That is what I call proud, soarin‚Äô Island View eagle flight.

As always, please reach out to me at 360-503-1490 or at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions.

Stay well-

Brian Hanrahan
