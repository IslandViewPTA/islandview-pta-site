It is Chocolate Bar season at Island View!  Nearly half of the money the PTA raises each year to fund all the amazing events at services at our awesome school comes from this Chocolate Bar sale in the fall.  

Who will win the HUGE bear on display at school?  How many keychain bears will your student collect?

Sign your students up NOW to participate!  Either online at www.IslandViewPTA.org/chocolate, or send in the blue permission slip.  

And THANKS for your help with this vital, and FUN, fundraiser!
