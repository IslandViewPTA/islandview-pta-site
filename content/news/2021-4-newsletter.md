## Principal's Message

Island View Families:

On a Saturday morning several years ago, students planted hundreds of tulip bulbs in our parking lot flower beds. It was a pre-pandemic day when we were able to be together and drink hot chocolate and work shoulder-to-shoulder, our hands in the soil and our unmasked laughter pealing freely. I know we all hope for the return of those days.

As Superintendent Justin Irish recently communicated to ASD families, district staff are preparing for the possibility of having students back in school for full days soon. The subsequent planning is complex and involved. Staffing, transportation, and food service challenges need to be resolved. At Island View, plans need to be developed for whole-school arrival and dismissal procedures, lunch and recess routines, classroom furniture needs, and cleaning and safety protocols. Yet here is the good news: we have creative and accomplished district-level and school-based teams addressing these challenges. I am confident we will get our students back to fulltime school in a safe and smart manner.

Also, I would like to thank parents once again. Our success these past months could not have occurred without your patience, cooperation, and partnership. Students, staff, and families have inspired me beyond words. Thank you.

But letâ€™s get back to our tulips. ðŸ˜Š While we have lost a good number of bulbs to pesky squirrels and other critters, each morning and afternoon I am outside greeting your beautiful students, I check on the resilient few. They are growing healthy and strong. I cannot wait to see their graceful heads fill with color before long. They remind me that normalcy and beauty returnâ€”always. Itâ€™s the same lesson your students teach me every day.

Please reach out to me at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) or at 360.503.1490 if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions. I wish families a restful spring break full of memory-making moments.

In gratitude-

Brian
