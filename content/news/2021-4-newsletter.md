## Principal's Message

Island View Families:

On a Saturday morning several years ago, students planted hundreds of tulip bulbs in our parking lot flower beds. It was a pre-pandemic day when we were able to be together and drink hot chocolate and work shoulder-to-shoulder, our hands in the soil and our unmasked laughter pealing freely. I know we all hope for the return of those days.

As Superintendent Justin Irish recently communicated to ASD families, district staff are preparing for the possibility of having students back in school for full days soon. The subsequent planning is complex and involved. Staffing, transportation, and food service challenges need to be resolved. At Island View, plans need to be developed for whole-school arrival and dismissal procedures, lunch and recess routines, classroom furniture needs, and cleaning and safety protocols. Yet here is the good news: we have creative and accomplished district-level and school-based teams addressing these challenges. I am confident we will get our students back to fulltime school in a safe and smart manner.

Also, I would like to thank parents once again. Our success these past months could not have occurred without your patience, cooperation, and partnership. Students, staff, and families have inspired me beyond words. Thank you.

But let’s get back to our tulips. 😊  While we have lost a good number of bulbs to pesky squirrels and other critters, each morning and afternoon I am outside greeting your beautiful students, I check on the resilient few. They are growing healthy and strong. I cannot wait to see their graceful heads fill with color before long. They remind me that normalcy and beauty return—always. It’s the same lesson your students teach me every day.

Please reach out to me at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) or at 360.503.1490 if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions. I wish families a restful spring break full of memory-making moments.

In gratitude-

Brian

## Yearbook Cover Contest Winners!

The winner of the 2020 - 2021 yearbook cover contest is Mia Rogers! Her original artwork will serve as the cover of the yearbook. Second place winner is Paige Burfield - whose work will be featured on the back cover!

Our fourth graders voted to select the top two art pieces. Then the entire student body voted for which piece would appear on the cover.

We received so many wonderful pieces of art this year, and we're very impressed and humbled to see the hard work and talent of our fifth graders. All art submitted to the contest will be featured throughout the yearbook.

Please email your photos to [**yearbook@islandviewpta.org**](mailto:yearbook@islandviewpta.org). In the email please include your students’ names, grades, and teachers.

We’ll do our best to make sure everyone is included, so snap away! Thank you!

## Let's Walk & Bike to School!

**SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL** is looking for an Island View representative to attend monthly meetings and help promote safe walking and biking to school. Walking and biking are not only healthy ways to energize the brain before a day of class, but more kids walking and biking means fewer cars, cleaner air and less traffic around the school. Other easy fun duties of this position could include decorating display cases to promote planned events and recruiting help from the long list of amazing Island View volunteers. If you are interested, please contact Joan Pringle at [joanp@cityofanacortes.org](joanp@cityofanacortes.org) or Treva King at [tking@asd103.org](tking@asd103.org).

## I Love to Read Month Summary

**Island View Eagles had a wonderful month celebrating reading during March!**

Students built their own bookworms at home to showcase the books they read and entered the weekly raffle for a gift card to one of our fabulous local businesses. District staff members introduced themselves and read a book to our students each week throughout the month. Thank you to Dr. Irish, Dr. Clifford, Mr. Pohl, and Ms. Gilbert for enriching our students’ days. Heidi Williamson and Hannah Davis, our school Librarian, developed mystery books clues that students could try to solve each week.

And finally, ISV families could try to hunt down all 15 “books” posted in our amazing forest lands. Were you able to find all of them? We want to give a huge shout out to the teachers for encouraging our students’ participation and a big thank you to Mr. Hanrahan for his support at every step of the process. And a special THANK YOU to Kimberly Munoz for organizing such a wonderful month-long celebration of literacy!  Keep reading Eagles!

## Hospitality Thanks ASD Food Services

Island View PTA teamed up with Mount Erie PTA, Fidalgo PTA, Anacortes Middle School PTSA, and Anacortes High School PTSA to treat the hard-working kitchen staff to some treats last month. The lovely ladies were taken by surprise as Island View PTA hospitality committee member Molly Johnson dropped off a card, donuts, and flowers for each. We appreciate the long hours, continued ingenuity and flexibility these ladies have shown. Thank you so much for all that contributed!

**Stay tuned for details about celebratory plans for Staff Appreciation Week May 3-7, and how YOU can get involved!**
