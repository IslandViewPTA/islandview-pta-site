## Principal's Message

## YEARBOOK Photos Needed!

**Call for photos of Island View students doing the school thing! Make the 2020-2021 yearbook the best ever by submitting photos of your student(s).**

Please email your photos to [**yearbook@islandviewpta.org**](mailto:yearbook@islandviewpta.org). In the email please include your students’ names, grades, and teachers.

We’ll do our best to make sure everyone is included, so snap away! Thank you!
