## Principal's Message

Island View Families:

Having lived in the area for nearly thirty years, I cannot recall a longer string of sunny April days than we experienced this past month. It is indeed tulip time in the Skagit Valley. I hope you enjoyed memorable moments outside with your beautiful children.

As Superintendent Irish has communicated to families, we are currently planning to return all students back to full days. Island View staff members are busy developing new safety protocols, modifying arrival and dismissal procedures, planning lunch routines and recess schedules, and preparing changes in the instructional program. Our custodians are busy moving furniture back into classrooms and developing cleaning protocols, and kitchen staff are developing processes for serving lunches in new ways. I have been inspired by the team efforts that are creating a safe and meaningful school environment for your deserving students. I will send detailed information to families explaining our new protocols and schedules by Monday, May 3rd.

In the meantime, please contact me at 360-503-1490 or at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions.

Let‚Äôs get back to our sunshine. One of our kinders got in the habit of picking flowers (adults mistakenly call them dandelionsüòâ) for her teacher when she arrived on campus. On the morning of our first cool day, she stood in the front lawn and exclaimed despondently, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre all gone!‚Äù A staff member explained to her that the flowers would return with the sunshine; I‚Äôm not sure our little kinder was convinced.

But our sunshine is returning‚Äîone baby step at a time.

Stay well‚Äî

Brian Hanrahan

## Final PTA Meeting on May 25!

**Tuesday, May 25th at 6pm is the final PTA meeting of the year** (changed from the 27th).

We will have elections, vote on next year's budget, and discuss a few final fun events before summer...**so please plan to attend! Zoom link will be emailed.**

## Staff Appreciation Week

(Ask Stacey Mahoney ([hospitality@islandviewpta.org](mailto:hospitality@islandviewpta.org)) for a blurb and image about Staff Appreciation week)

YEARBOOKS ON SALE

(Get a blurb and image from Eric, but basically explain how folks can order yearbooks online, and if they order by ___ date, they get a dedication to their student included for free.)

## Color Run is June 5

**Save the Date for the Color Run on June 5th!**

We will need all hands on deck to pull off this super FUN event, so watch for a Sign Up Genius coming soon!

CLASS ACT SCHOOL PLAY  
(Ask Jessica Guzik ([jessica.swapp@gmail.com](mailto:jessica.swapp@gmail.com)) for a short blurb and hopefully an image from the wildly successful virtual school play that included all the elementary schools in the district. We may NOT share the link to the actual play, however.)

## 5th Grade Graduation

The 5th graders are about to move up to middle school, but before the eaglets soar off to become hawks, we want to celebrate them! **We need YOU to step up to lead the 5th grade graduation celebration committee!** We've got a budget and some ideas, but need YOU to make it all come together. Please email [president@islandviewpta.org](mailto:president@islandviewpta.org) to volunteer.

## Help the Garden Grow!

## Read-Aloud Video Library Open

Don‚Äôt forget to [visit the PTA website's digital read aloud library](https://www.islandviewpta.org/digital-read-aloud) to view the different read alouds from our school community. The videos will be available until the end of the school year.

## Let's Walk & Bike to School!

**SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL** is looking for an Island View representative to attend monthly meetings and help promote safe walking and biking to school. Walking and biking are not only healthy ways to energize the brain before a day of class, but more kids walking and biking means fewer cars, cleaner air and less traffic around the school. Other easy fun duties of this position could include decorating display cases to promote planned events and recruiting help from the long list of amazing Island View volunteers. If you are interested, please contact Joan Pringle at [joanp@cityofanacortes.org](joanp@cityofanacortes.org) or Treva King at [tking@asd103.org](tking@asd103.org).

## You're INCREDIBLE

**THANK YOU** t**o all those who supported the Island View PTA throughout an incredibly challenging and unpredictable year!** We are so grateful for the phenomenal support from families and the MANY opportunities your contributions make possible for Island View staff and students. **Please mark your calendars for a few final events, including the Color Run on May 5th.**
