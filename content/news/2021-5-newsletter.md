## Principal's Message

FINAL PTA MEETING

Tuesday, May 25th is the next PTA meeting at 6pm via zoom. (changed from the 27th) We will have elections and vote on next year's budget, so a good turn out is important. (Rachel is making a new graphic)

STAFF APPRECIATION WEEK

(Ask Stacey Mahoney ([hospitality@islandviewpta.org](mailto:hospitality@islandviewpta.org)) for a blurb and image about Staff Appreciation week)

YEARBOOKS ON SALE

(Get a blurb and image from Eric, but basically explain how folks can order yearbooks online, and if they order by ___ date, they get a dedication to their student included for free.)

COLOR RUN  
  
Save the Date for the Color Run on June 5th! We will need all hands on deck to pull off this super FUN event, so watch for a Sign Up Genius coming soon! (use image from last month)  
CLASS ACT SCHOOL PLAY  
(Ask Jessica Guzik ([jessica.swapp@gmail.com](mailto:jessica.swapp@gmail.com)) for a short blurb and hopefully an image from the wildly successful virtual school play that included all the elementary schools in the district. We may NOT share the link to the actual play, however.)

  
5TH GRADE GRADUATION  
The 5th graders are about to head off to middle school, but before the eaglets soar off to become hawks, we want to celebrate them! We need YOU to step up to lead the 5th grade graduation celebration committee! We've got a budget and some ideas, but need YOU to make it all come together. Please email [president@islandviewpta.org](mailto:president@islandviewpta.org) to volunteer.  
  
BUDGET TIME  
At 1pm on Tuesday, May 4th we will work on our budget via zoom. Please feel free to join us in planning what the PTA will do next school year! Email [president@islandviewpta.org](mailto:president@islandviewpta.org) if you would like the zoom link. (use budget image attached (unless you find a better one)

## Yearbook Cover Contest Winners!

The winner of the 2020 - 2021 yearbook cover contest is Mia Rogers! Her original artwork will serve as the cover of the yearbook. Second place winner is Paige Burfield - whose work will be featured on the back cover!

Our fourth graders voted to select the top two art pieces. Then the entire student body voted for which piece would appear on the cover.

We received so many wonderful pieces of art this year, and we're very impressed and humbled to see the hard work and talent of our fifth graders. All art submitted to the contest will be featured throughout the yearbook.

**It isn't too late to send in photos! Make the 2020-2021 yearbook the best ever by submitting photos of your student(s).**

Please email your photos to [**yearbook@islandviewpta.org**](mailto:yearbook@islandviewpta.org). In the email please include your students’ names, grades, and teachers.

We’ll do our best to make sure everyone is included, so snap away! Thank you!

## Let's Walk & Bike to School!

**SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL** is looking for an Island View representative to attend monthly meetings and help promote safe walking and biking to school. Walking and biking are not only healthy ways to energize the brain before a day of class, but more kids walking and biking means fewer cars, cleaner air and less traffic around the school. Other easy fun duties of this position could include decorating display cases to promote planned events and recruiting help from the long list of amazing Island View volunteers. If you are interested, please contact Joan Pringle at [joanp@cityofanacortes.org](joanp@cityofanacortes.org) or Treva King at [tking@asd103.org](tking@asd103.org).
