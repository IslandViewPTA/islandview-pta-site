## Principal's Message

Island View Families:

Having lived in the area for nearly thirty years, I cannot recall a longer string of sunny April days than we experienced this past month. It is indeed tulip time in the Skagit Valley. I hope you enjoyed memorable moments outside with your beautiful children.

As Superintendent Irish has communicated to families, we are currently planning to return all students back to full days. Island View staff members are busy developing new safety protocols, modifying arrival and dismissal procedures, planning lunch routines and recess schedules, and preparing changes in the instructional program. Our custodians are busy moving furniture back into classrooms and developing cleaning protocols, and kitchen staff are developing processes for serving lunches in new ways. I have been inspired by the team efforts that are creating a safe and meaningful school environment for your deserving students. I will send detailed information to families explaining our new protocols and schedules by Monday, May 3rd.

In the meantime, please contact me at 360-503-1490 or at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions.

Let‚Äôs get back to our sunshine. One of our kinders got in the habit of picking flowers (adults mistakenly call them dandelionsüòâ) for her teacher when she arrived on campus. On the morning of our first cool day, she stood in the front lawn and exclaimed despondently, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre all gone!‚Äù A staff member explained to her that the flowers would return with the sunshine; I‚Äôm not sure our little kinder was convinced.

But our sunshine is returning‚Äîone baby step at a time.

Stay well‚Äî

Brian Hanrahan

## Yearbook Cover Contest Winners!

The winner of the 2020 - 2021 yearbook cover contest is Mia Rogers! Her original artwork will serve as the cover of the yearbook. Second place winner is Paige Burfield - whose work will be featured on the back cover!

Our fourth graders voted to select the top two art pieces. Then the entire student body voted for which piece would appear on the cover.

We received so many wonderful pieces of art this year, and we're very impressed and humbled to see the hard work and talent of our fifth graders. All art submitted to the contest will be featured throughout the yearbook.

**It isn't too late to send in photos! Make the 2020-2021 yearbook the best ever by submitting photos of your student(s).**

Please email your photos to [**yearbook@islandviewpta.org**](mailto:yearbook@islandviewpta.org). In the email please include your students‚Äô names, grades, and teachers.

We‚Äôll do our best to make sure everyone is included, so snap away! Thank you!

## Let's Walk & Bike to School!

**SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL** is looking for an Island View representative to attend monthly meetings and help promote safe walking and biking to school. Walking and biking are not only healthy ways to energize the brain before a day of class, but more kids walking and biking means fewer cars, cleaner air and less traffic around the school. Other easy fun duties of this position could include decorating display cases to promote planned events and recruiting help from the long list of amazing Island View volunteers. If you are interested, please contact Joan Pringle at [joanp@cityofanacortes.org](joanp@cityofanacortes.org) or Treva King at [tking@asd103.org](tking@asd103.org).
