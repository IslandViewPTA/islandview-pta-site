# Principal's Message

Dear Island View Families:

First and foremost, I hope your family is healthy. The entire Island View staff has been remarkably impressed with the positive energy and patient understanding our families have shown as we’ve navigated our online continuous learning plan. Thank you.

While this spring has been obviously unique and difficult, I have been overwhelmed by your inspiring children. I have watched a fully choreographed and intricate dance video by a third-grade student. I have seen photographs of kids painting, performing karate, and preparing bakery-worthy pies. I have listened to student recordings of reading, mathematical problem solving, and coding. I have even enjoyed a virtual zoo field trip with a class. Much inspired learning has occurred the past several months.

Yet I realize that is not the whole story. I have had many conversations and communications with parents and students who are struggling mightily in our current situation. It is challenging to keep up with school communication. It is hard to engage young children in online learning, especially with parent work demands. This has not been an easy three months.

So, I ask you to give yourself and others grace—and know that we made it. Together, as a cohesive school community, we made it.

Looking ahead, I would like to congratulate our 5th graders on moving up to AMS! I cannot wait to see students and families later this week as we have our drive-thru events on Thursday and Friday. Logistical information can be found in my earlier email and in this newsletter.

Now, I wish you a restful and fun summer. Thank you for being part of our proud, soarin’ school community. As always, please reach out to me with questions, suggestions, or concerns at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) or at 360-503-1490.

With much gratitude,

Brian Hanrahan, Principal
