## Hospitality Updates

Hospitality kicked off the school year with an All-Staff Breakfast! Thank you to Kristen Lamb (on Facebook Kristen's Country Kitchen and pop-ups at Kennelly Keys) for catering breakfast burritos, fruit, drinks and dessert and PTA for providing the funding. 

### Stock the Staff Lounge! 

On October 28th, teachers will be conducting afternoon and evening parent conferences. Our staff are working hard; let's stock the staff lounge to keep them fueled all day! 

We have 55 staff members. Donations must be individually packaged and store-bought (check with Hospitality for any exceptions at [hospitality@islandviewpta.org](mailto:hospitality@islandviewpta.org)) and delivered to the Hospitality team (NOT Island View) by October 22nd. Sign up [here](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0d44aead2da3f58-stock).
