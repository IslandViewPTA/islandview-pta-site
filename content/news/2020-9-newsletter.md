On behalf of the entire school community, the Island View PTA would like to say a huge **THANK YOU** to the ASD administration, staff, and our beloved teachers! During a global pandemic, you are working so hard to make this year as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and wonderful for your students as you possibly can. You are adapting new curriculum, learning multiple platforms, and revising instruction to work in a virtual world. You are leaning into equity work with open hearts and minds ready to dive deep into long overdue conversations. You are prioritizing social and emotional learning which will help your students, and indeed the world, heal from this global trauma. You are doing everything you can to figure out how to build relationships and love your students the moment they ‚Äúwalk into your room.‚Äù Educators are truly Essential Workers and are the key to the entire economy. You are showing the world and your students what **resilience** really is. You are so very very appreciated and we are deeply honored that you do all you do for our children! THANK YOU!

## Principal's Message

Dear Island View Families:

While our summer break was filled with more challenges and anxiety than usual, I hope you found opportunities to rest and make meaningful memories with family and friends. Even during a pandemic, each day you have with your student is a gift to be cherished. My wife and I recently took our oldest son (an Island View alumüòä) to college, and I have to say memories and images of his elementary years have flooded my mind ever since. Savor this time and these waning summer days. They are truly special.

Anacortes district staff have worked hard this summer to create relevant and rich learning experiences for your students. But as you know, that is a challenging endeavor when classroom experiences are remote. While there is no way we can duplicate the joy and beauty of in-person learning, I still find validation and hope in our current reality. Validation because I better understand and appreciate the power of our school community. I miss you and your kids immensely, and I‚Äôve heard from many of you that your kids miss their friends and teachers. All these feelings underscore how valuable we are to one another.

I feel hope because our beautiful school community might be different, but it is still intact. I recently spoke to a mom of an incoming kindergarten student who also has an older sibling at Island View. She told me, ‚ÄúMy son has watched his sister at school, and he wants to do all the same things she got to do.‚Äù This conversation caught my attention and leads to this commitment: The Island View staff will find ways to support and engage your students in ways that make school feel ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù

To close, I want to thank you for the patience and grace you have shown the school district during these challenging times. In the coming weeks, I will send information on our virtual ‚Äúmeet and greet‚Äù and other back-to-school activities. As always, please contact me at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) or at 360-503-1490 if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions.

Fondly,

Brian Hanrahan
