## June 2021

## Principal's Message

## Color Run is June 19th

**Save the Date for the Color Run on June 19th!**

We will need all hands on deck to pull off this super FUN event, so watch for a Sign Up Genius coming soon!

## 5th Grade Graduation

**We want to continue the tradition of making our graduating 5th grade Eaglets feel celebrated before they head off to become AMS Hawks, but we need help!**

If you would be interested in leading the 5th Grade Graduation Committee and/or volunteering to help with the planning, please email [**president@islandviewpta.org**](mailto:president@islandviewpta.org) ASAP! **We've got a budget and some ideas, but need YOU to make it all come together.** Thank you!

## Help the Garden Grow!

Add info here if Ms. Shainin would like volunteers during the summer

## You're INCREDIBLE

**THANK YOU** t**o all those who supported the Island View PTA throughout an incredibly challenging and unpredictable year!** We are so grateful for the phenomenal support from families and the MANY opportunities your contributions make possible for Island View staff and students. **Please mark your calendars for a few final events, including the Color Run on June 19th.**
