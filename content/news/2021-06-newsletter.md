## 5th Grade Graduation

**We want to continue the tradition of making our graduating 5th grade Eaglets feel celebrated before they head off to become AMS Hawks, but we need help!**

If you would be interested in leading the 5th Grade Graduation Committee and/or volunteering to help with the planning, please email [**president@islandviewpta.org**](mailto:president@islandviewpta.org) ASAP! **We've got a budget and some ideas, but need YOU to make it all come together.** Thank you!
