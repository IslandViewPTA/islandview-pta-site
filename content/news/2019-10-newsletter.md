**_Principal‚Äôs Message_**

Dear Island View Families:

It‚Äôs official! The 2019-20 school year has truly begun. Our hallways are already lined with water-colored artwork, photos of smiling students, and construction paper cut-out hearts and apples. It is so good to have the building filled with your students and their positive enthusiasm for school.

This year we are implementing RULER with students. RULER is a framework for integrating social/emotional learning into schools developed at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. It is designed to help students **R**ecognize, **U**nderstand, **L**abel, **E**xpress, and **R**egulate their emotions. As a first step in our implementation, all classrooms are developing a Charter. Together, students identify how they want to feel in their classrooms and then brainstorm specific actions that nurture those feelings in themselves and others. For example, the students in one primary classroom decided they wanted to feel ‚Äúhappy.‚Äù They committed to acting in the following ways to create happiness:

¬∑ I will smile at others.

¬∑ I will act friendly.

¬∑ I will give compliments and use nice words.

Clearly, our students understand the importance of social and emotional well-being. Please ask your students about their class Charter and the specific emotions they want to feel at school. I also encourage you to check in with your students daily or weekly to see if their class Charter is working for them. The Island View staff is committed to creating a culture that is accepting, caring, and positive.

Our mission was made clear to me as I chatted with students at lunch recently. I asked one of our new students how she felt about being at Island View, and she said ‚Äúgood.‚Äù I wanted a bit more information, so I prodded and asked her what made the school ‚Äúgood.‚Äù

Her response was telling: ‚ÄúI feel comfortable here. Everyone is so nice, so friendly. It feels like a family. I like it.‚Äù

I like it, too. And I feel blessed to fly high with proud, soarin‚Äô Island View eaglesüòä.

_Brian Hanrahan, Principal_
