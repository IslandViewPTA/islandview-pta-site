## Principal‚Äôs Message

Dear Island View Families:

It‚Äôs official! The 2019-20 school year has truly begun. Our hallways are already lined with water-colored artwork, photos of smiling students, and construction paper cut-out hearts and apples. It is so good to have the building filled with your students and their positive enthusiasm for school.

This year we are implementing RULER with students. RULER is a framework for integrating social/emotional learning into schools developed at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. It is designed to help students **R**ecognize, **U**nderstand, **L**abel, **E**xpress, and **R**egulate their emotions. As a first step in our implementation, all classrooms are developing a Charter. Together, students identify how they want to feel in their classrooms and then brainstorm specific actions that nurture those feelings in themselves and others. For example, the students in one primary classroom decided they wanted to feel ‚Äúhappy.‚Äù

They committed to acting in the following ways to create happiness:

* I will smile at others.
* I will act friendly.
* I will give compliments and use nice words.

Clearly, our students understand the importance of social and emotional well-being. Please ask your students about their class Charter and the specific emotions they want to feel at school. I also encourage you to check in with your students daily or weekly to see if their class Charter is working for them. The Island View staff is committed to creating a culture that is accepting, caring, and positive.

Our mission was made clear to me as I chatted with students at lunch recently. I asked one of our new students how she felt about being at Island View, and she said ‚Äúgood.‚Äù I wanted a bit more information, so I prodded and asked her what made the school ‚Äúgood.‚Äù

Her response was telling: ‚ÄúI feel comfortable here. Everyone is so nice, so friendly. It feels like a family. I like it.‚Äù

I like it, too. And I feel blessed to fly high with proud, soarin‚Äô Island View eaglesüòä.

_Brian Hanrahan, Principal_

## Watch D.O.G.S.

If you're a Dad (or a Mom serving as a Dad) in search of a flexible volunteer opportunity at Island View, we need you! With the help of parent/adult volunteers, Watch D.O.G.S. (Dads of Great Students) aims to underscore the importance of education while providing extra support during the school day.

Any frequency or length of time is appreciated, so don‚Äôt worry if you aren‚Äôt able to devote an entire school day. An hour or two makes an incredible difference to our students.

If you are interested in joining or have further questions, please contact the Watch D.O.G.S. coordinator [Eric Mithen](mailto:vicepresident@islandviewpta.org).

## Family Fun Night - Pumpkin Carving

**October 25th, 5:30 - 7 p.m.** in the Island View cafeteria. (No refreshments served at this event).

{{< fig src="IMG_9581.JPG" class="max-w-xs" align="right" >}}

Come enjoy a fall classic - pumpkin carving at Island View!

Our wonderful Watch D.O.G.S. proudly sponsors this fun night to get in the spooky spirit of Halloween. **Every child in attendance receives a free pumpkin to carve and take home (while supplies last), so arrive early!**

Some carving tools will be available and feel free to bring your own. **_Special thanks to Schuh Farms for their generous support._**

## BOX TOPS!

A great way to earn money for Island View is changing...BOX TOPS are the little tags on the top flap of many General Mills products that earn Island View $0.10 per item when the tag is cut out, brought to school, and redeemed by the PTA.

As of the end of October, **BOX TOPS will no longer accept physical tags as the program is shifting to an entirely digital format,** by way of a [downloadable APP](https://www.boxtops4education.com/ "Box Top App link") on your phone.

And here's a [listing](https://www.boxtops4education.com/Participating-Products-Page "Box Top eligible items") of BOX TOP eligible purchases...remember, every eligible purchase is worth $0.10 for Island View!

Just a few short weeks to round up BOX TOPS tags and **drop them in the container in the front office by October 25th!**

## Book Fair arrives in November

## Gift Items for Holiday Basket

{{< fig src="holiday lantern scene.jpg" title="holiday lantern image" align="right" class="max-w-xs" >}}

Anacortes Schools Foundation (ASF) raises and directs money for scholarships, programs, learning experiences, and materials benefitting our students from preschool through college entrance. One of their major fundraising events, Celebrate the Season, is coming up and they've asked for our help!

[Sign up](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0d44aead2da3f58-items) to purchase an item and bring it to the PTA office by Nov 25th with a note "For Nicole" on it. The items will be compiled in a phenomenal, jaw-dropping basket for the event on Dec 7.

When shopping, kindly select items that are seasonal in theme--think "festive winter"--so as to appeal to the widest range of bidders!

## Anacortes School District Volunteer Background check

_DON'T FORGET!_

**All volunteers must have a _yearly application_ and background check on file with the district office prior to service in our schools.** (All volunteers must re-apply each school year.)

The beginning of the school year is an excellent time to complete the process, so that you can be ready to volunteer in the schools or chaperone a field trip.

The application link can be found [here](https://apps.raptortech.com/Apply/NDU4OmVuLVVT "Raptor ASD link").
