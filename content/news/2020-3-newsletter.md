## Principal's Message

Dear Island View Families:

After a very soggy February, we are seeing early signs of spring. In my morning walks to school, I hear quiet bird chatter, and recently when I cross-walked students at the end of the school day, I saw the first green shoots from the tulip bulbs our students planted two years ago. I have come to realize that March is the month of patience. Yet rest assured, spring always arrives.

As an educator I appreciate the month of March for another reason: it is free from breaks. Staff and students hunker down for full, five-day weeks to learn, grow, and create beauty together. March is also a productive time before spring state and district assessments begin. I will send information and assessment schedules to families once they are finalized in April.

As many of you know, I recently interviewed for the superintendent position here in Anacortes. I was not selected as a finalist.

First, I would like to thank many of you for your kind and positive support. Your notes, emails, and spoken words meant the world to me. As I prepared for my interview, I recognized that I lack experience that would help me assume such an important role in our district. Yet I stayed committed to the road I was traveling, and in the end, I have to say I am proud of myself. I worked hard and felt fully prepared; I did not shy away from an intimidating process; and I presented my authentic and true self, which was my primary goal.

**Isn’t that what we want for our students?** Work hard. Set lofty goals. Stay true to yourself. As the Island View principal, I am happy to model that kind of proud, soarin’ flight.

I trust our school board members. They are upstanding, smart people who are deeply invested in our school community. They will hire a strong superintendent to lead us in our beautiful work. I have every confidence in that reality.

As always, please contact me with any questions, concerns, or suggestions you have at 360-503-1490 or at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org).

Happy Spring!

Brian Hanrahan, Principal

Join us for a magical, memorable hour of reading...CAMP STYLE! Mark your calendars for **Thursday, March 19 from 6:30-7:30 pm for our 'Camp Out with a Good Book' event**. Bring a book or two, a flashlight or battery-powered lantern, and a soft pillow or blanket to get cozy in the Island View 'campground' set up in the school theater.

Volunteers are needed for this event, [sign-up](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0d44aead2da3f58-camp) to lend/set-up tents and camp chairs.

## Staff Appreciation March 23

In order to show our continued appreciation for the amazing staff at Island View, the Hospitality committee will host an event in the school foyer. **Mark your calendars for March 23 (10:45 through lunch)**, all staff are encouraged to stop by for a serving of treats and drinks while their students are on the playground.  
(Leftover items will be available in the lounge for those who cannot stop by.)

## Color Run Planning & Fun

{{< fig src="color_march.jpg" class="max-w-xs" align="right" >}}

**Save the Date for the most anticipated event of the year: The Color Run on May 16!** Fundraising will begin after spring break; in the meantime, please join us in planning for this super fun event. Our next planning meeting is **Tuesday, March 10 at 2:30pm** at school.

## SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS

{{< fig src="orange bike.jpg" class="max-w-xs" align="left" >}}

Want to make school zones safer for everyone? The more kids who walk, bike and bus to school, the fewer the number of cars on the road. In addition to the health benefits of walking and biking, fewer cars means less pollution. And kids who travel in groups are safer. It's a win-win.

The city is looking for a PTA rep (or two) to help encourage and plan fun SRTS events. Please contact Treva King for more information. [trevaking@yahoo.com](mailto:trevaking@yahoo.com).

## Mark your calendars for RIF!

{{< fig src="rif.png" class="max-w-xs" align="right"  >}}

**Reading is Fundamental (RIF)** is a wonderful national program that gives free books to K-3 students twice a year. The students get to pick their very own books, smiles abound, and the love of reading is born!

**This is a fun event that can't happen without volunteers!** April 28 is the big day and help is needed to assist with set-up, short shifts during the day, and cleanup. Sign up [here](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0d44aead2da3f58-spring4) and support our youngest readers!

## It's time to think...YEARBOOK
