## Principal's Message

Dear Island View Families:

After a very soggy February, we are seeing early signs of spring. In my morning walks to school, I hear quiet bird chatter, and recently when I cross-walked students at the end of the school day, I saw the first green shoots from the tulip bulbs our students planted two years ago. I have come to realize that March is the month of patience. Yet rest assured, spring always arrives.

As an educator I appreciate the month of March for another reason: it is free from breaks. Staff and students hunker down for full, five-day weeks to learn, grow, and create beauty together. March is also a productive time before spring state and district assessments begin. I will send information and assessment schedules to families once they are finalized in April.

As many of you know, I recently interviewed for the superintendent position here in Anacortes. I was not selected as a finalist.

First, I would like to thank many of you for your kind and positive support. Your notes, emails, and spoken words meant the world to me. As I prepared for my interview, I recognized that I lack experience that would help me assume such an important role in our district. Yet I stayed committed to the road I was traveling, and in the end, I have to say I am proud of myself. I worked hard and felt fully prepared; I did not shy away from an intimidating process; and I presented my authentic and true self, which was my primary goal.

**Isn’t that what we want for our students?** Work hard. Set lofty goals. Stay true to yourself. As the Island View principal, I am happy to model that kind of proud, soarin’ flight.

I trust our school board members. They are upstanding, smart people who are deeply invested in our school community. They will hire a strong superintendent to lead us in our beautiful work. I have every confidence in that reality.

As always, please contact me with any questions, concerns, or suggestions you have at 360-503-1490 or at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org).

Happy Spring!

Brian Hanrahan, Principal

## March PTA Meeting

## Food Drive Appreciation

A shout out to all of Island View for generously donating 994 cans/food items in the third annual 100 Day Food Drive. We crushed out goal of 700 cans! Second grade won a cookie party for collecting the most cans.

## Taco Bar Dinner for Teachers a Hit!

{{< fig src="Taco Bar.jpg" class="max-w-xs" align="right"  >}}

The PTA is so grateful for all those that brought food to feed teachers a delicious taco dinner during conference week. It smelled incredible in the lounge and the teachers said thank you over and over again!

## March is I Love To Read Month

Every March, Island View students and staff celebrate reading all month long! This year we have tons of new and fun ways to dive into a good book and share your experience with others. Look for information going home at the end of February and get ready to celebrate reading like never before!

## Picture Day is Two Weeks Away

Spring Picture Day is March 10! Students will take a picture with their full class, and individual pictures will be available for those interested. Helpers are needed! Please email membership@IslandViewPTA.org if you have time to help that day.

## Garden Clean Up Party

{{< fig src="spring_cleanup.pdf" class="max-w-xs" align="left"  >}}

Come out to the Island View Garden on Saturday, March 14 at 10 a.m. and help get our amazing school garden ready for students to plant. Join the fun as we weed, mow, spread bark and enjoy the morning together. We are looking for a few people to bring wheelbarrows and edgers. Questions: email erinwolfswinkel@gmail.com.

## Color Run

**Save the Date for the most anticipated event of the year: The Color Run on May 16!** Fundraising will begin after spring break; in the meantime, please join us in planning for this super fun event. Our next planning meeting is Tuesday, March 10 at 2:30pm at school.

## SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS

{{< fig src="orange bike.jpg" class="max-w-xs" align="left" >}}

Want to make school zones safer for everyone? The more kids who walk, bike and bus to school, the fewer the number of cars on the road. In addition to the health benefits of walking and biking, fewer cars means less pollution. And kids who travel in groups are safer. It's a win-win.

The city is looking for a PTA rep (or two) to help encourage and plan fun SRTS events. Please contact Treva King for more information. [trevaking@yahoo.com](mailto:trevaking@yahoo.com).

## Mark your calendars for RIF!

**Reading is Fundamental (RIF)** is a wonderful national program that gives free books to K-3 students twice a year. The students get to pick their very own books, smiles abound, and the love of reading is born!

**This is a fun event that can't happen without volunteers!** April 28 is the big day and help is needed to assist with set-up, short shifts during the day, and cleanup. Sign up [here](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0d44aead2da3f58-spring4) and support our youngest readers!

## It's time to think...YEARBOOK

Calling All Photographers!

Our yearbook is in production, and we need your school event photos! Do you have treasured images from field trips, classrooms, lunches, recess, or pre/after school events? We'd love to publish them.

{{< fig src="camera.jpg" class="max-w-xs" align="left" >}}

Just email your images to [yearbook@islandviewpta.org](mailto:yearbook@islandviewpta.org) or drop off a disk or flash drive at the office. Please be sure to include your name and contact information with all submissions, along with the teacher and/or classroom for the students in your photos. Photos should be high resolution color JPGs.

We can't wait to see what you've got. Thank you! {{<break>}}
