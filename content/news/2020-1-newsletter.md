## Principal's Message

Dear Island View Families:

Welcome to 2020! I hope you enjoyed a festive and restful holiday season with friends and family.

That said, the holidays can be a taxing and stressful time for adults and children. I must admit, I’m looking forward to returning to the routine of being at Island View and resuming our wonderful work with your students.

As part of my holiday greeting to staff before the start of winter break, I shared the following story:

> Staff-
>
> As I was leaving school one recent evening, I stopped to admire the simplicity of the little white flowers in my office and noticed one button-head was looking away from me and toward the wall. I chuckled out loud and thought to myself, “That flower reminds me of… (a “defiant” student I had worked with that day).
>
> Then it hit me.
>
> Turn the vase around, Brian, and that one little flower is no longer defiant; instead, it is pleasant and radiant. **A different perspective changes everything**.
>
> That change in perspective reminded me of a quote from _The Secret Garden_: “If you look the right way, you can see that the whole world is a garden.” Isn’t that a lovely way to see our students? It’s a perspective that allows us to see the unique beauty and wonder in each little Island View eagle—every day.
>
> That is the reminder I will carry with me into 2020.

As always, please let me know your questions, concerns, and suggestions. I can be reached at 360-503-1490 or at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org).

Happy New Year!

Brian Hanrahan, Principal
