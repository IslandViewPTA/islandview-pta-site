## Principal's Message

Island View Families:

February proved to be an eventful month. Our students celebrated Valentine‚Äôs Day in a wonderfully ‚Äúnormal‚Äù way‚Äîthey crafted red and pink hearts, traded cards and store-bought treats, and spread much love throughout our school community. The very next day, we all awoke to a blanket of snow that turned Anacortes into a veritable winter wonderland. I was so pleased to hear stories of sledding, snow angels, and snowball fights. Our students, who have been through so much this year, deserved all the fun and excitement!

Now we turn our attention to March and spring conferences. While I will miss the opportunity to welcome family members into our building, I am thankful for the opportunity to pause and connect with our parents. I am sure you will enjoy your time with teachers.

March is also the time we celebrate I Love to Read. The month and event are particularly poignant to me because when school closed on March 16 last school year, our students were creating a celebratory ‚Äúbook worm‚Äù that filled our hallways. After we closed, I remember feeling heavy emotion as I walked the halls and saw our incomplete bookworm. Now a year later, we have new challenges‚Äîand new opportunities. The Island View PTA has created an I Love to Read Month that will hopefully capture our students‚Äô imaginations and creativity. Please look in this newsletter and on the PTA Facebook page for all the ways your students can engage in fun reading adventures.

Soon the daffodils will appear, and the tulips will follow close behind. But let‚Äôs not forget the winter magic we experienced this past month. It‚Äôs a good reminder to us all: each season brings joy and beauty. Especially when you‚Äôre surrounded by inspiring little Island View Eagles. üòä

As always, please contact me at 360-503-1490 or at [bhanrahan@asd103.org](mailto:bhanrahan@asd103.org) if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions.

## 2021-2022 PTA Officers Needed

Several PTA officers are at the end of their term limits and we need leaders to help guide the way. Both the current president and vice-president will still have children at Island View next year, and will happily help you throughout the year.

Leading our PTA as president or vice president has little to do with spreadsheets, event planning, or writing checks. It has everything to do with your compassion. You can make the time commitment as little/much as you wish. Many hands make light work! A presidency can be filled by multiple people. You and a co-president can determine and divide jobs any way you like.

Next year‚Äôs board is helmed by a committed treasurer, a veteran secretary, and a membership chair who also maintains our amazing social media presence. They won‚Äôt let you fail.

The unknown can be scary, so reach out and let us dispel any concerns you might have. If you‚Äôve ever been remotely interested in diversifying your contribution to our PTA, let us know.

THANK YOU for considering stepping up to serve as a PTA officer. We hope to hear from you soon.
