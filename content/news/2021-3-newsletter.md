## Hospitality News & Events

**The Hospitality Committee is excitedly looking forward to Valentine's Day!** We will be spreading the love by decorating the school's exterior doors on Friday, Feb. 12. Students will be bringing home a red or pink piece of construction paper if they would like to contribute to the school decorations. Bins will be placed outside the student/bus drop off areas for students to bring their decorations on Feb. 4 and 8.

**Donut Delivery!** The Island View PTA sweetened the first day back for bus drivers with the delivery of two dozen Donut House donuts. Hospitality volunteer Jenessa Eelkema dropped off the donuts in the predawn hours of Jan 11 and we received this kind note in return, "With much gratitude...Thank you for the donuts on Monday at the bus garage, we did not leave any crumbs!"

**Let us know if you would like to be part of the magic of the Hospitality Committee, showing our love by sharing edible joy!** [hospitality@islandviewpta.org](mailto:hospitality@islandviewpta.org)

## Box Tops Benefit Island View

**Box Tops is an EASY way to earn money for our school!**

If you have any physical Box Tops, they're still collecting them. If you are willing and able to download the Box Tops app and scan your receipts, any Box Tops eligible items are automatically calculated. Every little bit counts, especially this year!

## Amazon Smile Helps Island View

**Thank you to everyone who has Island View PTA selected as their designated non-profit through Amazon Smile!**

If you haven't already, it's SUPER EASY! Just designate Island View PTA as the non-profit you'd like the donation made to, shop as usual, and Amazon does the rest!

## Give the Gift of Membership

The new year is an ideal time to give something meaningful to others by gifting a [membership to Island View PTA! ](https://www.islandviewpta.org/membership)

Membership entitles you or someone dear to you to join the ranks of the most caring and dedicated PTA on Fidalgo Island. Don't forget to sponsor a staff membership, as we are currently **only 4 staff members away from 100% staff membership!**

## You're INCREDIBLE!

**THANKS** all those who have supported the Island View PTA already. We are deeply committed to the staff and students at Island View Elementary and we could not provide the MANY opportunities we offer without your support!
