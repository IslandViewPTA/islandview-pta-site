**Let's give a huge shout-out to T-Shirts By Design!**

Earlier this year, Island View PTA members voted to add a Rachel's Closet donation option to the order form in hopes of adding some spiritwear to the selection. After our spring spiritwear order, our PTA was able to donate 4 Island View shirts and 2 Island View hoodies to the collection.

That's pretty cool, right?

Corinne Peickert at T-Shirts By Design thought so, too, so she donated **2 huge bags** of Island View spiritwear to our Rachel's Closet!

**Thank you so much to Corinne at T-Shirts By Design for your generous donation!**
