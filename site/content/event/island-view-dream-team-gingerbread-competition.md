Help us cheer on the Island View "**Dream Team**" teachers at the annual Anacortes Schools Foundation "Celebrate the Season" fundraiser. 

Island View teachers Chad Sage, Emily Mansfield, Monica Frost, Sarah Slagle, Pat Tonnemaker, and Angie Hawkins will compete against other teams to create the best gingerbread house. 

While you're there, get a photo with Santa, make craft projects, warm-up with hot chocolate and cookies, and enjoy the holiday shopping marketplace offering unique gifts and food items. 

There is no admission charge.
