Celebrate the 100th day of school by helping local food banks. 

Each grade level is challenged to bring in 100 cans of non-perishable food to be donated to local food banks through [A Simple Gesture - Anacortes](https://www.facebook.com/asimplegestureanacortes/?fref=mentions). 

Red bins will be available in the main entrance for students to drop off donations starting Tuesday, January 30th and finishing on the 100th day of school, February 8th.
