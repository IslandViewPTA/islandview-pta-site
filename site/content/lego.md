[FIRST LEGO League Jr](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/flljr) is more than just Legos. Your team of 4-6 friends will EXPLORE a challenge related to a real-world theme, CREATE a model using LEGO WeDO 2.0 technologies, and SHARE the excitement of discovery at community expos and showcases.

Students who participate will explore STEM concepts and real-world scientific problems such as food safety, recycling, energy, etc. They’ll create a Show Me poster that illustrates their journey of discovery and construct a model of what they learned using Lego elements. In the process, teams learn about teamwork, the wonders of science and technology, and the [FIRST LEGO League Jr. Core Values](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/about-fll) which include respect, sharing, and critical thinking.
