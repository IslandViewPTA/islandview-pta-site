Welcome to the landing page for the Island View Elementary [FIRST LEGO League Jr](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/flljr) program. We are looking for interested students and **two** adult coaches per six-student team. We are starting out with the non-competitive program for 1st-4th graders in February 2018. Teams will meet for 1 to 1.5 hours per week, for 12 weeks. Coaches should plan on an hour or two each week of prep time before their teams meet. At the end of the 12 weeks, the teams will have an opportunity to show off their work at an Expo in Anacortes, or nearby. Each student will pay **$40** to join the program (scholarships are available through the PTA).

If all goes well, we may also start the First Lego League (not Jr.) program for 4th-5th graders starting in late August 2018. That would be a competitive league, so must all start at the same time each year.
