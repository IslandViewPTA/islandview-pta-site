### Celebrate the 100th day of school with 100 cans of food! 

Let's help support our local food banks and celebrate the 100th day of school with a 100th Day Food Drive! 

**Goal: 100 cans per grade level**

Each grade is challenged to bring in 100 cans of non-perishable food to be donated to local food banks through A Simple Gesture. Big red bins will be available in the main entrance for students to drop off donations. 

**Deadline extended to Wednesday, February 27, 2019.**

The grade level that brings in the most donation items will win a Tootie Pop party!
