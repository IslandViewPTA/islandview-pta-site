description: Bring your bike in for a quick tune-up before school

Wednesday, April 25, 2018 is the Spring Bike Maintenance/Tuneup event in the Island View Gym starting at 8:15 am. 

All kids are invited to bring their bike in for a quick check and see if it needs a tune-up.  It should be a beautiful, bright, sunny day in the PNW.  Please take advantage of this FREE opportunity!  Also, it is a great opportunity for them to get some exercise and push large volumes of oxygenated blood to their brain before the day of learning starts.

Try to get there close to 8:15, if possible! There is a healthy line right before school starts, and arriving early avoids any chance of any unnecessary tardiness.

If you would like to volunteer at the event and would be willing to help out with some simple tasks like checking kids in, etc., we could use your help.  1-2 volunteers would be great if you have time tomorrow and are a register school volunteer.

We hope to see you there!
