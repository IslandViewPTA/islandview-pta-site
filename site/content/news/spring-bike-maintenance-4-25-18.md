Tomorrow, Wednesday, April 25th, we have the Spring Bike Maintenance/Tuneup event in the Island View Gym starting at 8:15 am. 

  
All kids are invited to bring their bike by on what should be a beautiful, bright, sunny day in the PNW.  Please take advantage of this FREE opportunity to have their bike looked over and tweaked (if needed).  Also, it is a great opportunity for them to get some exercise and push large volumes of oxygenated blood to their brain before the day of learning starts.

  
The closer the kids can arrive to 8:15, the better because it always seems like there is a healthy line right before school starts but no one is in line when the event initially kicks off.  Arriving early avoids any chance of any unnecessary tardiness.

  
If you would like to volunteer at the event and would be willing to help out with some simple tasks like checking kids in, etc., we could use your help.  1-2 volunteers would be great if you have time tomorrow and are a register school volunteer.

  
We hope to see you there!
