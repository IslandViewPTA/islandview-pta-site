### (W)rappers wanted!

I'm from Island View and I'm here to say

We must protect our books from wear every day.

From spills to tears to crumbs and more...

Those books need plastic covers, which is such a chore.

Can you help? Can ya' please?

Can you help with library needs?

Ms. Davis needs help from a few volunteers

Stop by anytime for some library cheers!

Ok, so that wasn't the kind of (w)rapping our librarian Ms. Davis requested... Before books can be checked out by your students, they must be wrapped in a protective cover. Ms. Davis has a TON of books ready to be wrapped and put on the shelves.

#### How can you help?

Whenever you have a spare 20 minutes at school, please swing by the library and Ms. Davis will show you how to wrap. I can't guarantee you'll sound like Macklemore when you're done, but you'll definitely help our school! For more information, email Sally Davis at sdavis@asd103.org.
