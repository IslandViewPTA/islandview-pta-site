Join the Watch DOGS for a tulip bulb planting party at Island View!   
  
On Saturday, February 3 at 10:00 a.m. at the front entrance, we'll plant over 100 tulip bulbs around the school. Rain or shine - hot chocolate provided!   
  
The real excitement will come this spring as you see your tulips emerge and brighten our school. Some planting tools will be available, but please bring gardening gear if you've got it!
