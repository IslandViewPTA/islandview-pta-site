March is “I Love to Read” Month! Reading logs will be sent home on Thursday, March 1st. Students will record their reading minutes and turn their logs in once a week to have them counted. 

**All kids who participate will be entered for a chance to win one of two bikes!** 

Weekly prizes and top individual/class reader prizes will also be handed out at a special assembly at the end of the month.
