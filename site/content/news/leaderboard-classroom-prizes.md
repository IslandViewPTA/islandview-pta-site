Help your classroom win PRIZES!

Updated: 4/30/2018

The classroom that has the highest participation will win a game of kickball with Mr. Hanrahan! 

Currently, Ms. Holert's room is winning BOTH classroom prizes! The classroom with the highest participation wins a game of kickball with Mr. Hanrahan, and the classroom that brings in the most money wins an ice cream party!

Note: I'll update these graphs throughout the week as students bring in their donations. The LAST day is Friday, May 4!
