**It's not too late to order your yearbook!**

Order by June 8, 2018 to reserve a copy for your student. Flyers will be sent home in this week's yellow folders, or you can [download one here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1matll5BVGnMWguIQCf-fr5S_B4fdub4v/view?usp=sharing "2017-2018 Yearbook Order Form"). 

Yearbooks will be distributed at Field Day on June 13, 2018. Additional books will be available for purchase, but supplies are limited.

Students who earned a free yearbook by raising $100 for the Color Run will automatically receive their yearbook at Field Day. No order form required! 

If you have any questions, please contact Christy Fischer. president@islandviewpta.org
