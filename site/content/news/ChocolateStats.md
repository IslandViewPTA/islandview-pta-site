**Island View PTA's fundraiser is off to a fantastic start!**

As of 9/25/18, our school has raised $6,512 of our $18,000 goal! 

Ms. Frost's class held their lead for another day in the Classroom Sales competition with $782. The classroom that brings in the most money wins an enormously delicious 5 pound chocolate bar to share with the class!

Ms. Shainin's class currently leads the Classroom Participation competition with 70% of students helping to sell chocolate bars. Ms. Slagle and Ms. Frost are close behind with 67% each. The winning class will get a game of kickball with Mr. Hanrahan!
