**Island View PTA's fundraiser is off to a fantastic start!**

As of 9/26/18, our school has raised $7,730 of our $18,000 goal!

Ms. Frost's class is hungry for some chocolate! They held their lead for yet another day in the Classroom Sales competition with $1,022! The classroom that brings in the most money wins an enormously delicious 5 pound chocolate bar to share with the class!

Ms. Frost's class is also leading the school in the Classroom Participation competition with 72% of students helping to sell chocolate bars. Ms. Shainin and Ms. Slagle are close behind! The winning class will get a game of kickball with Mr. Hanrahan!
