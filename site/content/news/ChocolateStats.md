**Island View PTA's fundraiser is off to a fantastic start!**

As of 10/1/18, our school has raised $11,642 of our $18,000 goal! This is INCREDIBLE! We're so close to reaching our goal!

Because of the wild success students have had selling chocolate bars at the Saturday soccer games, we've decided to extend the deadline to **MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2018.**

_(Reminder: Deliver your money envelopes to the PTA office or the PTA drop box. Please don't give them to your teacher.)_

Ms. Frost's class continues to lead the competition with $1,442! Ms. Dale is close behind with $1,020, along with Ms. Goforth ($961) and Ms. Wedul ($960). The classroom that brings in the most money wins an enormously delicious 5 pound chocolate bar to share with the class!

Ms. Frost's class is also leading the school in the Classroom Participation competition with 72% of students helping to sell chocolate bars. Ms. Shainin and Ms. Slagle are close behind! The winning class will get a game of kickball with Mr. Hanrahan!

It's not too late to join the fun! To request your box of chocolate, register online at [www.islandviewpta.org/chocolate](https://www.islandviewpta.org/chocolate "Island View PTA World's Finest Chocolate Fundraiser").
