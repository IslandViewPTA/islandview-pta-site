**Island View PTA's fundraiser is off to a fantastic start!**

As of 10/4/18, our school has raised $13,595 of our $18,000 goal! We're so close to reaching our goal! Let's keep that momentum going!

Because of the wild success students have had selling chocolate bars at the Soccerday - I mean, Saturday - soccer games, we've decided to extend the deadline to **MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2018.**

_(Reminder: Deliver your money envelopes to the PTA office or the PTA drop box. Please don't give them to your teacher.)_

Ms. Frost's class continues to lead the competition with $1,502! Ms. Holmes's class has jumped up to $1,260, and Ms. Wedul and Ms. Dale are close behind! The classroom that brings in the most money wins an enormously delicious 5 pound chocolate bar to share with the class!

Ms. Frost's class is also leading the school in the Classroom Participation competition with 72% of students helping to sell chocolate bars. Ms. Shainin and Ms. Slagle are close behind! The winning class will get a game of kickball with Mr. Hanrahan!
