**School's out... Movie's on!**

There is no school on Friday, September 28th - but you can still see all your friends!

Join us at Anacortes Cinema on Friday at 10:00am for a special showing of **Small Foot** on opening day!

For $10, you'll get admission, popcorn and a soda. [Purchase your tickets online](https://www.islandviewpta.org/movie), or watch for a flyer to come home with students. 

This movie event is open to **EVERYONE**, so bring your friends!

And thank you for supporting the Island View PTA!
